1
00:00:00,002 --> 00:00:08,003
There's lots of other ways to think about
this idea of how thinking about the

2
00:00:08,003 --> 00:00:16,303
question gets us to change our mindset and
therefore take a different action.

3
00:00:16,304 --> 00:00:21,269
Let's take another example, imagine I ask
you how often do you floss your teeth?

4
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,887
And I gave you a scale from 0 to 9 times
or more a day.

5
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:31,437
Or I gave you a scale from 0 to 9 times or
more a month.

6
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,407
And I gave you one or the other of those
scales.

7
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:36,720
If you got the top scale what would you
do?

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,418
You would answer somewhere on the left.
If I got you the bottom scale you'd answer

9
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:44,410
somewhere more to the right.
Unless of course you never floss.

10
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,947
In which it would be, identical.
And now what?

11
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:53,560
Now you would not just stop there.
You would infer something about your own

12
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,305
hygiene habit.
If you got the top scale you would say,

13
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:57,180
whoa.
My goodness.

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,600
Look at me.
I'm at the top.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,910
I'm at the left side of the scale.
I'm not doing very well.

16
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,530
I'm below the norm.
And if you've got the bottom scale you

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,834
would say, look at me.
I'm at the top of my game, I'm way above

18
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,896
the norm.
Nobody is better than me, basically.

19
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:16,046
Now again, if we did this and let you go,
your opinion and understanding thought

20
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:21,020
about this will basically decay over time.
But what if just after feeling one of

21
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,493
those scales, I asked you hey, I have a
number here, should we call a dentist,

22
00:01:25,493 --> 00:01:29,800
should we call a hygienist, should we
schedule an appointment for you.

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,979
Now, your changing your momentary mindset
could be translated into a decision and

24
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,464
determine what happens.
If you got the top scale, you would say,

25
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:43,149
let's call now, let's make an appointment.
And if you got the bottom scale you would

26
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:46,789
say, well, no need to worry.
I don't need to meet any doctor or any

27
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:49,778
dentist.
Now, I'll give you another example for the

28
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:53,570
same thing.
Imagine I was your financial adviser, and

29
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,299
I asked you to think about retirement.
And in one case I would ask you to think

30
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:02,134
about the financial crisis and the days in
which you lost lots of money, and how

31
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:06,186
miserable those days were.
In other case I would ask you to imagine

32
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:09,724
how it would be like to retire to the
Bahamas and golf, and fish, whatever,

33
00:02:09,724 --> 00:02:13,110
whatever you want.
I kind of painted a nice picture of that.

34
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,264
If I put you in one of those two mindsets
and then I ask you how much risk do you

35
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:22,890
want to take in your investment portfolio.
You would make very different decisions.

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,388
If I just told you about all the misery of
losing money you would say, I don't want

37
00:02:26,388 --> 00:02:29,327
to experience this again.
Let's be safe.

38
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:32,838
If I talk to you about all the wonderful
things that you could do if you had enough

39
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:35,441
money to retire you would be willing to
take much more risk.

40
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:41,254
Now, if I did these exercises and stopped
there Nothing bad would happen because you

41
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:45,108
would forget over time.
But if I took those two very different

42
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:48,310
opinions and now optimized your portfolio
base on that.

43
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,297
Now I could change your outcome for the
next year in terms of your returns.

44
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:57,214
Based on these arbitrary starting points.
And if the next year, you came to see me,

45
00:02:57,214 --> 00:03:01,060
would we start from scratch to thinking
about your investment strategy?

46
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,370
Of course not.
We would look at what we did last year.

47
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,520
We'd take that as a starting point and
behave again and again and again.

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,474
And this is how a momentary mindset can
translate not only into a decision.

49
00:03:14,475 --> 00:03:18,547
But to a more and more and more decision
over time.

50
00:03:18,548 --> 00:03:22,749
There's another way to think about the
extent to which we don't know our

51
00:03:22,749 --> 00:03:27,009
preferences and how the choices we're
being presented with are going to

52
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:30,240
influence what result.
So consider the following case.

53
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,265
Imagine I'm offering you a great deal and
I say, hey I can send you.

54
00:03:34,266 --> 00:03:38,810
To 1 week for vacation in Rome, all
expenses paid.

55
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,275
I'm paying for flight, I'm paying for
hotel, I'm paying for breakfast every

56
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,753
morning.
Or I can send you for a full paid, prepaid

57
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:49,477
vacation, I'm paying for everything, to
Paris.

58
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:53,112
And they say, Rome or Paris?
Now, some people have very strong

59
00:03:53,112 --> 00:03:55,260
preferences.
They love Rome, they hate Paris.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,058
The other way around.
But for most people this is a very

61
00:03:58,058 --> 00:04:00,250
difficult decision.
Which one do you want?

62
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,420
Which one is better?.
Now imagine I added another choice to this

63
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,533
set.
I said, free vacation in Rome, free

64
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:11,260
vacation in Paris or, having your car
stolen.

65
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,726
Sounds like a crazy idea because in what
universe, adding a undesirable option like

66
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:21,680
having your car stolen would influence
Your choice between Rome and Paris.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,095
It turns out there is a version like that.
By the way, if you just add having your

68
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:31,050
car stolen, nobody wants that.
But there's another version which we call

69
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,667
"Rome minus", and Rome minus is just like
Rome.

70
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:37,753
It's a full week in Rome, all expenses
paid.

71
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:42,459
Flight, hotel, breakfast every morning,
but the breakfast doesn't include coffee.

72
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,449
You want coffee?
It's 2 euros 50, and you're on your own.

73
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:50,618
Now, think what, what does this Rome minus
does to the choices?

74
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:55,072
Here is what it does.
When you think to yourself, when you say,

75
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:59,628
"Rome versus Paris," you say, "They are so
different," different art, culture,

76
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:05,098
language, romance, food: Not sure.
Now if you say Rome without coffee and

77
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,522
Paris.
I'm not sure either, it's not as if the

78
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:11,566
coffee is a decisive factor.
But when you have Rome without coffee and

79
00:05:11,566 --> 00:05:16,400
Rome that comparison is very, very clear.
Rome with coffee is much, much better than

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,894
Rome without coffee.
And what happens now.

81
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:25,129
As Rome without coffees entering the set.
It makes Rome with coffee looks better,

82
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:30,550
not just relative to Rome without coffee,
but also better than Paris.

83
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,724
And what you can see is that when we add
Rome without coffee.

84
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:37,796
People start choosing Rome.
Now, it's also works for Paris, you add

85
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,221
Paris without coffee, people start
choosing Paris.

86
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:47,104
And what this suggests is that when we add
an option that is not desirable, it can

87
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:51,285
nevertheless change how people view the
other option.

88
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:57,766
This is the relativity principle.
Its the contrast between Rome- and Rome

89
00:05:57,766 --> 00:06:02,082
that makes it so attractive.
Here's another example for this.

90
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:07,419
Quiet a few years ago, one of my friends
pointed out to me that there was these

91
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,114
websites of economists, and they had this
offer.

92
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:14,967
And he said, look, look at this offer.
I looked at it and it was really quite,

93
00:06:14,967 --> 00:06:17,420
quite interesting.
And here's the offer.

94
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,393
What would you like?
Would you like to get a subscription for

95
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:25,416
the Economist.com for $59, the electronic
version?

96
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:30,035
The print version for 125?
Or both of them for 125?

97
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,337
Now when you read this, you say to
yourself, why is the middle option there?

98
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:40,120
What possible thing could it do?
Right, why would anybody want that?

99
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,345
Now by that time I already did all kinds
of research on this Decoy Effect we call

100
00:06:44,345 --> 00:06:47,399
it the asymmetric governance in the decoy
effect.

101
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,576
So I was really happy to see this ad and I
called The Economist and I have to say

102
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:55,606
that I was really hoping that they would
say, oh, Dan, it's you, we're so happy,

103
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:59,603
we're so glad you called!
We read one of your papers and we tried to

104
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:01,714
implement it!
This was not the case.

105
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:05,744
In fact, I don't think they know they knew
about my research and.

106
00:07:05,745 --> 00:07:09,790
And they passed me from one person to
another to another to another until

107
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,630
finally I get to the person in charge of
their website.

108
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,388
And I say, could you please explain to me
where did you get this idea, and would you

109
00:07:16,388 --> 00:07:18,510
be willing to do some experiments with
this?

110
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,603
And they said, of course, I'll get right
back with you and this was, you know,

111
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:24,343
many, many years ago.
I never heard from them again.

112
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:30,006
So I decide to do the experiment myself.
I gave these particular sheets to a group

113
00:07:30,006 --> 00:07:35,466
of MBA students and basically looked at
what they wanted to choose, and here is

114
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:39,220
what we got.
Few people wanted the online version, the

115
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,878
vast majority wanted the combo deal and
thankfully no one wanted the wasted option

116
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:49,502
in the middle, nobody wanted to pay the
same amount for less, great.

117
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:53,410
Now here's the thing, if you had three
options and one of them had zero market

118
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,507
share, would you keep it.
Of course not.

119
00:07:56,508 --> 00:08:00,736
So for another group of students, I kicked
the middle option out, I just presented

120
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:04,079
the top and the bottom.
And what happened now, the market share

121
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,362
reversed.
The thing that was the least desirable

122
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:11,571
became the most desirable, the thing that
was the most desirable, became the least

123
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,614
desirable.
Why?

124
00:08:12,614 --> 00:08:18,114
Because the middle option, while being
useless, in the sense that nobody wanted

125
00:08:18,114 --> 00:08:23,936
it was nevertheless important because it
defined the framework by which to evaluate

126
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,280
these options.
Think for a second.

127
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,870
Is fifty nine dollars for the economies
dot com for the online version is a good

128
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,747
deal or a bad deal?
How would you know?

129
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:42,100
How would you think about it?
Is the 125, $125 for the combo deal, a

130
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,834
good deal or a bad deal, compared to what?
60 letters?

131
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:51,926
50 letters in Newsweek?
Or how is the comparison really going to

132
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,800
happen?
So the middle option, while nobody wanted

133
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,820
it, it gave a framework to think about the
two options.

134
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,600
In fact it gave you a framework to think
about the bottom option.

135
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:08,089
Relative to $125 for the print version
alone, $125 for both seems like a good

136
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,114
deal.
In fact it makes it look.

137
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:12,260
Like you're getting the online version for
free.

138
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:17,237
And this relative comparison makes
something looks much, much better.

139
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:21,092
So there are 2 things here.
The first one is to suggest that we just

140
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:25,450
don't know how to evaluate.
It is really hard for us to evaluate.

141
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,885
And because of that option that we don't
even choose Enter into our comparison

142
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:38,617
mindset, and can influence how we view the
options and relative advantages end up

143
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:45,295
being important, decisive advantages.
There's one more very interesting aspect

144
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:50,968
of relatively in prices that comes from
Bob Frank's work, and his book the

145
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:56,055
Darwin's Economy.
And in that book by the way, a book, Frank

146
00:09:56,055 --> 00:10:02,191
argues that the, real godfather of modern
economics say should not be Adam Smith.

147
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:07,282
He should be Darwin.
And he gives the following analysis.

148
00:10:07,282 --> 00:10:12,189
He said that imagine if you were a lion
seal, and, and its the mating season.

149
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,940
And what happened is for lion seals, is
you want to be the biggest one of the lot.

150
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,570
Because the biggest lion seal get all the
females, virtually all the females.

151
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,259
The second one gets a few, but it's mostly
about the biggest lion seal gets all the.

152
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,630
All the females and all the ability to
reproduce their genes.

153
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:35,964
So what happens in this world?
You want to be slightly bigger than other

154
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:39,098
lion seals.
Now, do you care how big everybody is?

155
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:42,188
No.
But in relative terms, you just want to be

156
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,563
slightly bigger.
Now the reality is that with lion seals,

157
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:49,803
this is a really sad thing.
Because as each one of them, struggle to

158
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:54,702
be slightly higher, slightly bigger than
the other, they become incredibly large

159
00:10:54,702 --> 00:10:59,388
and they are so large these days that they
die at young age from all kinds of heart

160
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:04,358
problems and vascular problems and they
also sometimes crash the females when they

161
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:07,913
copulate.
And if you think about its race to the top

162
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:11,836
that is perfectly sensible for each lion
seal, right?

163
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,668
If you're the second largest lion seal
you're not going to rest until you become

164
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:18,970
the biggest.
But nevertheless its destructive for the

165
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,340
whole environment for the whole ecosystem.
My grandfather was an economist he, used

166
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,133
to work for the U.N.
Developing tax system.

167
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:32,394
For developing countries and he explained
to me once, when I was very young, what is

168
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:35,098
inflation.
And he said, imagine that you're in a

169
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:39,445
concert, a musical concert and everybody's
sitting and everybody's enjoying the

170
00:11:39,445 --> 00:11:41,610
music.
All of a sudden the people in the from

171
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,438
row, stand up and then the people in the
second row have to stand up and the people

172
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,170
in the third row and soon enough everybody
has to stand.

173
00:11:48,171 --> 00:11:52,010
At the end of the day everybody sees just
the same as they, when they were sitting

174
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,508
down, but everybody is more uncomfortable.
And this was his explanation of inflation,

175
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,930
and if you think about it that's what
happens.

176
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,962
When everybody just worries about their
own relative position, there's a chance

177
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:07,222
for destroying the whole eh, Eco,
Eco-system.

178
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:12,066
And Robert Frank also shows that this is
what has happened, one of the things that

179
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:16,817
happened in the housing market in the U.S.
So imagine that you're a, a young couple

180
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:21,037
and you have a couple of kids, and you
want your kids to go to good schools.

181
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,730
If you're in the U.S., how do you get kids
to go to good school?

182
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,822
You go to a good neighborhood, because
neighborhoods are the ones that are

183
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:32,178
funding local schools, so the easiest way
to get into a good school is to go into a

184
00:12:32,178 --> 00:12:34,100
Good neighborhood.
So what you're doing?

185
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,940
You're trying to push yourself into the
get to the best neighborhood, you can.

186
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,626
You're kind of extending your economic
ability to the highest amount you can in

187
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:45,440
order to get to the best, district that
you can.

188
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,350
And now, what you have done.
You've done that.

189
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,630
What are the consequences?
As he shows, there's, increased domestic

190
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:55,977
violence.
Divorce and of course bankruptcy.

191
00:12:55,978 --> 00:13:01,219
And here's the notion, the moment we
create a system, where everybody try to

192
00:13:01,219 --> 00:13:06,863
just fight a little bit harder to get just
a little bit above, we can give people the

193
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:11,437
ability to destroy not just themselves but
the whole ecosystem.

194
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:13,389
I want to show you one more example of
this.

195
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,888
This was a study with physical attraction.
Often when you see somebody face to face,

196
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:23,043
you have an immediate feeling of whether
you're attracted to them or not.

197
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:27,827
So we want to study whether this same
effect also happen in physical attraction.

198
00:13:27,828 --> 00:13:31,148
So we took pictures of students.
In this eh, illustration here, I'm not

199
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,700
showing you students, I'm showing you
computer images.

200
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,735
But in the experiment, that were, they
were.

201
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:39,550
Students, and we asked people, who would
you like to date?

202
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,347
Would you like to date Jerry, or would you
like to date Tom?

203
00:13:43,348 --> 00:13:47,697
And so some people, we took Photoshop and
we made Jerry slightly uglier.

204
00:13:47,698 --> 00:13:51,956
And we asked people, who do you want to
date, Jerry, ugly Jerry, or Tom?

205
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:56,439
And other people, we asked, do you want to
date Jerry, Tom, or ugly Tom?

206
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,669
And the question what, we had was whether
ugly Jerry would help disproportionally

207
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:05,716
Jerry, and would ugly Tom
disproportionately help Tom, and this was

208
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:09,156
indeed what we found out.
Now these results have two very

209
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:14,170
straightforward, simple implications.
The first one is that if you ever go bar

210
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:20,487
hopping, who do you want to take with you?
Who is the ideal wing man or wing woman?

211
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:24,198
Now you know.
It's somebody who is similar to you but

212
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:27,900
slightly less attractive.
That's kind of the optimal approach.

213
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,196
And the second thing is, that if somebody
asks you to come with them as their wing

214
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:35,089
man or wing woman, now you know how they
think about.

215
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,873
I should point one more thing, I got a
letter from this woman at Cornell who said

216
00:14:41,873 --> 00:14:46,634
that after reading this information she
started using this approach, she started

217
00:14:46,634 --> 00:14:51,464
taking her roommate with her because she
thought she was a slightly less attractive

218
00:14:51,464 --> 00:14:55,216
version of her.
And she went from her from party to party

219
00:14:55,216 --> 00:14:59,792
to party in, at Cornell.
And it worked very well by her accord.

220
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:03,576
The only thing was after a few months she
decided to tell her friend why she was

221
00:15:03,576 --> 00:15:07,110
carrying her with her to all these
parties, which of course backfired.

222
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,753
So if you're doing this trick don't tell
the person, about that.
