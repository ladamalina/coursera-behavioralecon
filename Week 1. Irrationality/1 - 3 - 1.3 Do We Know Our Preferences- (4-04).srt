1
00:00:00,784 --> 00:00:08,162
If you think about this question of
defaults, what it really relies on, and

2
00:00:08,162 --> 00:00:12,650
the fact that we don't really know what to
do.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,450
You know, if you grow up in a country and
your parents told you to always donate

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,625
your organs or always buy jam, or always
maximize your retirement funding, none of

5
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:27,294
these interventions would make sense.
But the issue is that we just really don't

6
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:30,562
know what we want.
And because we don't know what we want, we

7
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:33,210
use the environment as a guide to what we
want.

8
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,116
We use the environment as the way to
influence our thinking, and therefore,

9
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:41,253
change, what we end up choosing.
So for now what I want to do next, is I

10
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:45,877
want us to think about the extent to which
we don't know our preferences.

11
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,202
So think about the following.
Imagine I asked half of you to think about

12
00:00:50,202 --> 00:00:53,810
three reasons why you love your
significant other.

13
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:58,298
And I asked the other half to think about
ten reasons why you love your significant

14
00:00:58,298 --> 00:01:00,773
other.
Now if you don't have anybody right now,

15
00:01:00,773 --> 00:01:04,450
think about somebody you want to be with,
rather than somebody you left.

16
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,018
But think about it.
Imagine you have to think about three

17
00:01:08,018 --> 00:01:10,544
reasons, imagine you have to think about
10.

18
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:13,830
And I would give you maybe 10 minutes to
think about one of those things.

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,854
And at the end of the 10 minutes I would
say, okay, please stop.

20
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:20,614
And tell me how much do you love your
significant other, on a scale from zero to

21
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,870
ten?
And what do you think you'll buy them for

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,110
their birthday and what would you buy them
for your anniversary?

23
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,369
And do you think you'll be together in a
year, three year, five year, ten years?

24
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,704
What do you think, should it matter,
whether I ask you to think about three

25
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,388
reasons or ten?
Of course it shouldn't matter, because I

26
00:01:38,388 --> 00:01:41,700
didn't tell you anything new.
It's not as if I came to you and I said,

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,390
you know what, I just met your significant
other, what a wonderful, warm, kind human

28
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:49,250
being, I was just amazed.
There was no information.

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:54,057
I only asked you to reflect about somebody
you know very, very well.

30
00:01:54,058 --> 00:01:57,388
Well does it matter?
Of course it does, I wouldn't present it

31
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:00,474
otherwise.
So who do you think declared greater love

32
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:03,984
to their significant other?
People who are asked to think about three

33
00:02:03,984 --> 00:02:06,182
reasons or people asked to think about ten
reasons?

34
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:12,955
Here's the thing.
The reality is that it's very, very, very,

35
00:02:12,955 --> 00:02:16,837
very, very difficult to come up with ten
reasons.

36
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,357
So what happens to people who were asked
to think about ten reasons?

37
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,220
They get stuck.
They get stuck on reason six, seven,

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,940
eight, nine, ten.
And as they get stuck they say to

39
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,108
themselves, how much possibly can I love
this person?

40
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:33,463
And because of that, they reduce their
understanding of how much they love the

41
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:36,910
significant other.
And because of that, people who were asked

42
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,070
to think about three reasons, declare
greater love than people asked to think

43
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,750
about ten reasons.
By the way, just as a comment I should

44
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,834
say, you don't have to have ten reasons to
love somebody, maybe one reason is enough.

45
00:02:47,835 --> 00:02:51,633
It's not about that it's really important
to have ten reasons.

46
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,911
But when you tell people to think about
ten reasons and they fall short, the

47
00:02:55,911 --> 00:03:00,534
standards make them think, that they are,
some how something is not okay with the

48
00:03:00,534 --> 00:03:03,250
relationships.
The same thing by the way, works with

49
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,490
BMWs.
It turns out that there are not ten

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,860
reasons to buy a BMW.
And you ask people to think about ten

51
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,406
reasons, they get stuck, and they say,
maybe I don't need one.

52
00:03:13,406 --> 00:03:18,197
I don't like to admit it or not, but I use
the same trick in teaching.

53
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:22,050
At the end of each class, when I teach in
front of an audience, the dean likes to

54
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,350
see high teaching evaluations.
So one of the easiest thing to do is to

55
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,571
just before the students fill in their
evaluation for the term, I ask them to

56
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:33,925
think about 15 ways in which this class
could be improved.

57
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:38,472
Presumably, 15 are too many, they run
short and they come up to the conclusion

58
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:43,405
this was a fantastic class and this is how
they fill the end of the year evaluation.

59
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:48,434
Now, if I did that in the beg-, in the
middle of the semester, the 15 reasons,

60
00:03:48,434 --> 00:03:52,630
they will probably forget.
But if I do it just before they fill in

61
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:57,481
the end of year evaluation, now I can
change their momentary mindset, their

62
00:03:57,481 --> 00:04:02,332
momentary understanding of how good this
class is, and then I can get higher

63
00:04:02,332 --> 00:04:04,003
teaching evaluations.
