1
00:00:00,953 --> 00:00:10,802
When we think about all the mistakes
people make in decisions what, what does

2
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,646
it tell us.
So first we can think about what does it

3
00:00:14,646 --> 00:00:19,642
tell us about standard economics.
In standard economics, we have a beautiful

4
00:00:19,642 --> 00:00:23,370
view of human nature.
Shakespeare wrote, what a piece of work is

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,630
man.
How noble in reason, and so on, and so

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,636
forth.
And now, while this is a very nice view of

7
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:34,424
human nature, it would be really nice to
think about people as capable and able

8
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:38,428
unencumbered by emotions, able to think
about all the options.

9
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:43,120
Compute everything, consider everything in
a deep way and making always, always,

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,176
always the right decision.
In behavior economics we are not that

11
00:00:47,176 --> 00:00:50,995
generous to people.
Instead we think of people as myopic and

12
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:55,970
vindictive, easily confused, don't know
what they want, and so on and so forth.

13
00:00:55,970 --> 00:01:00,642
In many ways this is a more depressing
perspective of human nature, but I also

14
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:03,804
think it's much more useful as a
perspective.

15
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:07,780
In fact I think there are three main
lessons that we can take from behavior

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,646
economics.
The first one is to recognize that we have

17
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:16,346
many, many faults.
The many decision biases the many things

18
00:01:16,346 --> 00:01:19,918
we don't do right.
That's the first thing is just to realize

19
00:01:19,918 --> 00:01:23,070
that we have these faults across a huge
range of activities.

20
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,569
The second thing to realize is that we
don't have good intuition.

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,384
About all of those faults.
Is not, it's not as if we see them, and we

22
00:01:30,384 --> 00:01:34,660
recognize them easily.
And then the third point, which comes from

23
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,992
the first two, is that if we have faults
and we don't recognize them, we need

24
00:01:39,992 --> 00:01:42,850
experiments.
We need not to rely on our intuition.

25
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:46,034
Instead we need to measure exactly what is
going on.

26
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:50,770
In the same way that in a visual illusion,
you have to measure exactly the length of

27
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,102
a table in a table illusion.
You have to measure the color in the cube

28
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:56,690
illusion.
If you rely on your own intuition you will

29
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,770
get it wrong, in the same way that when we
set things that rely on human behavior, we

30
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,650
can't just rely on our intuitions.
We have to rely on actual measurement.

31
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,971
We have to do experiments, and we have to
test ourselves.

32
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:12,072
And maybe a good analogy to think about is
the American FDA.

33
00:02:12,072 --> 00:02:16,351
So the Food and Drug Administration forces
physicians to do experiments.

34
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:21,142
They take physicians who think they have a
good idea of how to do something better.

35
00:02:21,142 --> 00:02:25,564
And they say before you implement it and
before you force some patients to do it,

36
00:02:25,564 --> 00:02:29,919
we want you to prove to us that this is
going to pass through some scientific

37
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,795
barrier.
And you know what, there's lots of things

38
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:36,307
that after doing them for many years we
discover were bad idea.

39
00:02:36,308 --> 00:02:40,208
For example, cough medications.
For 30 years, we gave cough medication to

40
00:02:40,208 --> 00:02:43,410
kids until we figure out that this was
actually a bad idea.

41
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,200
Not a neutral idea.
A bad idea.

42
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,860
Back surgeries, for a long time they did
all kinds of back surgery for things that

43
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,210
they showed later on were useless.
And so there's many, many exp, experiments

44
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,980
and things like that, that you have an
intuition of why this particular

45
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,074
medication, this particular procedure
would work.

46
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:06,386
But in fact they don't and you know what
we have to force physicians with these

47
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,332
experiments.
Because the physicians think that they

48
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:12,243
know whats good.
They have a theory of what would work and

49
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:16,402
they want to give it to all the patients.
But we don't let them we stop them and we

50
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:19,570
say sorry you can't just follow your
intuition and do it.

51
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,970
And I think we need the same discipline.
For governments and businesses.

52
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,593
I think we need the same intuition to tell
people in government before you apply any

53
00:03:27,593 --> 00:03:31,881
particular policy that is going to be
affecting a lot of people, we want you to

54
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:35,080
test it and show us that in, it's indeed
actually useful.

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,826
And to businesses too.
I think businesses before they apply

56
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:40,592
something or do something, I think they
should have their own barrier.

57
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:45,330
Of what is the proof that they are going
to consider before they go in to apply

58
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,905
something and if we took a bit more
modesty in what our opinions are and how

59
00:03:49,905 --> 00:03:54,148
successful and correct we are.
I think we would actually do things in a

60
00:03:54,148 --> 00:03:57,874
better way.
In, in Roman times, there was this famous

61
00:03:57,874 --> 00:04:02,957
saying called Memento Mori.
And the idea was that as generals had

62
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:07,442
victories in all kinds of battle fields,
they would come to Rome and they would

63
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:10,142
have a parade.
And people would yell at them and

64
00:04:10,142 --> 00:04:14,698
celebrate, and they would wear gold and
all kinds of, get gifts and showered with

65
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:17,979
presents and so on.
But in the same way that they were hailed

66
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:21,515
as gods for the day...
They also had a slave that was stationed

67
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:25,148
next to them, walking next to them.
And saying all the time in the ear,

68
00:04:25,148 --> 00:04:29,210
memento mori, memento mori, which meant,
remember, you are mortal.

69
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,140
Remember, you are mortal, don't let get,
that get into your head.

70
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,230
And that's, I think it's the same way to
remind us of.

71
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,424
Remember that we're limited.
Remember that we're irrational.

72
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:44,020
Remember that we have all of these
decisions, problems, and we need to think

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,500
about how to test ourself and check
ourself and don't trust our intuition to a

74
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,885
high degree.
So if you start doubting yourself, what do

75
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:55,972
you do?
And for me the big lesson to take is to

76
00:04:55,972 --> 00:05:00,806
follow what computer hackers do.
So, I have a very good friend who's a

77
00:05:00,806 --> 00:05:03,900
computer hacker and I love what he's
doing.

78
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,330
And he basically told me what computer
hackers do.

79
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,430
And he said that what computer hackers do
is they take a procedure and they write it

80
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,190
in exact details.
They say this is server and there's a

81
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,580
computer, and there's a protocol that
happens here.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,793
And there's a handshake happening here,
and this information passes, this

83
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:23,261
information passes and they look at the
whole sequence, very, very long sequence

84
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:27,100
of things that can happen.
And then they say, and where can we

85
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,645
interrupt?
And where can we slow down and what can we

86
00:05:29,645 --> 00:05:32,367
change?
And how can we get a different result?

87
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:35,720
And I think from a behavioral perspective,
we want to do the same thing.

88
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,050
We want to look at the small details of
how something happens.

89
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,390
How do we enroll in the retirement plan?
And how do you enroll in organ donation?

90
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,809
And how do you decide what TV to get and
so on?

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,240
And then we want to say, where can we
interfere in?

92
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,252
Where can we get things to behave
differently, and where can we improve

93
00:05:52,252 --> 00:05:55,242
things?
And I think this is basically the recipe

94
00:05:55,242 --> 00:05:59,190
for how to take social science research
and make it applicable.

95
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,478
You make a list of the exact behavior in
small details and then you think about

96
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:10,251
where you could apply different things.
And as a final point, I want to go back to

97
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,597
my nurses.
As I told you I started thinking about

98
00:06:13,597 --> 00:06:18,069
this whole field by thinking about how to
remove bandages from burn patients.

99
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:22,658
When I finished all my research I went
back to the hospital, I gave a lecture to

100
00:06:22,658 --> 00:06:26,728
the doctors and the nurses.
And they listened and responded, and we

101
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:30,133
had some discussion.
But when I finished, my favorite nurse,

102
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,470
Etty, came to me and she said two really
interesting things.

103
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:37,397
The first thing that she said was that I
did not think about her pain.

104
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,492
This was no picnic for her, either.
She was standing there removing my

105
00:06:40,492 --> 00:06:42,335
bandages.
This was not something that she was

106
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,756
enjoying.
Maybe she was not suffering like I was,

107
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:50,353
but this was not great for her either.
But we quickly agree that, [laugh] role of

108
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:55,060
medical treatment is not to minimize the
nurse's pain.

109
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,360
Even though for her, it would have been
good to just squeeze the duration.

110
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,460
Make it as short as possible.
And get out of there as quickly as

111
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,576
possible.
But then I said, okay but why don't you

112
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:08,240
just try my suggestion?
You don't have to accept it.

113
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,077
You don't have to adopt it for all time.
Why don't you just do it a few times?

114
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:15,864
And what she said was really interesting.
She said, every day she could have done

115
00:07:15,864 --> 00:07:20,328
what she thought was the right thing to
do, which is the quick removal of the

116
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,017
bandages.
What everybody does, which is the quick

117
00:07:23,017 --> 00:07:26,244
removal of the bandages.
And what she thought was good for me and

118
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:30,497
good for her.
Or, she could do what I suggested.

119
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:33,840
Which was not good for her.
She thought was not good for me.

120
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,070
And nobody else did it.
And under those conditions, everyday she

121
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,560
was just following her best intuition of
what's the best thing to do.

122
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,890
And she was doing every day and every day.
And I think it happens to us all the time.

123
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:50,565
We stand at intersection in the road
every, many times a day.

124
00:07:50,565 --> 00:07:55,173
And there's a path that we've taken
before, that everybody else takes and our

125
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:58,779
intuition tells us to take.
And then this other path that we haven't

126
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:02,712
taken before and we don't know much about
it but our intuitions are pointing us away

127
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:06,432
from that.
And I think that if you thought that you

128
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:09,363
might be irrational, and you might have
bad intuitions.

129
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:13,924
It also means that, from time to time, it
will be useful to try and take this other

130
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:14,480
path.
You know?

131
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,200
And sometimes, you might take this other
path.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,387
And you would realize that you were right
all along.

133
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:21,161
And that's perfectly fine.
Then you've wasted a little bit of time,

134
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:24,130
money, and effort.
But sometimes, you might take this path,

135
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,419
and you might realize that this was
actually a better path.

136
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,132
And if you take the big lesson from me,
from all of social science, it's to doubt

137
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:36,200
our intuitions.
And if you doubt your intuition, it means

138
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,755
you should experiment more.
You should ask yourself, why am I making

139
00:08:39,755 --> 00:08:42,830
this decision?
Is it because it's really better, or I

140
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:45,990
just think so?
And if it's only because I just think so,

141
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,054
maybe it's the right time to try something
else.

142
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:53,120
Maybe I should try it and figure out.
And for particularly for things we are

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,140
going to make decisions over and over and
over, there is huge potential payoff in

144
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,696
trying something out and seeing whether it
leads to better efforts.

145
00:09:00,696 --> 00:09:04,816
So this is it for today.
I hope this was useful.

146
00:09:04,816 --> 00:09:09,843
I hope you would have a bit more humility
in how you...

147
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:16,316
Think about yourself and hoping for better
decisions in the future.

148
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:58,943
[music].
