1
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:08,550
Hi, my name's Gavan Fitzsimons. 
I'm the R. 

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,570
David Thomas professor of marketing and 
psychology here at Duke University. 

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,834
today I'm going to be taking a little 
time to tell you about some of the work 

4
00:00:15,834 --> 00:00:20,548
we do in our lab. 
focused around an issue that we like to 

5
00:00:20,548 --> 00:00:24,685
call the unconscious consumer. 
And usually when I say the term 

6
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:28,162
unconscious consumer in one sort of, 
package like that, it starts to make 

7
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:32,636
people a little bit nervous. 
And I say, wait a second, I'm not 

8
00:00:32,636 --> 00:00:37,263
unconscious when I'm in consumption mode. 
When I'm walking through a store, I know 

9
00:00:37,263 --> 00:00:40,865
exactly what I'm doing. 
But I'm choosing between two autombiles, 

10
00:00:40,865 --> 00:00:44,900
I know exactly what I'm doing. 
When I'm deciding whether to have that 

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,806
snack or take a pass, I know exactly what 
I'm doing. 

12
00:00:48,806 --> 00:00:52,405
In fact, what I'm going to do today is 
try to convince you that far more is 

13
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:56,309
occurring outside your conscious 
awareness than you'd like to believe when 

14
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,475
you're in consumption mode. 
I thought I'd start out, I had sort of 

15
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,637
three little ideals that I'd like tell 
you about, but I though I'd start out 

16
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:09,52
with a personal anecdote. 
This is going back a little ways, to when 

17
00:01:09,52 --> 00:01:13,290
I was a graduate student myself. 
I was I was living New York at the time, 

18
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,980
I was a graduate student at Columbia. 
And, it was a January night, it was maybe 

19
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:27,680
40ish degrees Fahrenheit, 2 or 3 Celsius 
and it was kind of drizzly and rainy out. 

20
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,80
I realized had I ran out of Diet Coke. 
This was quite a tragedy for me. 

21
00:01:32,80 --> 00:01:36,153
I love Diet Coke. 
I needed to fill my fridge with Diet Coke 

22
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:39,544
immediately. 
So I was in short, soccer shorts, and a 

23
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:43,251
t-shirt and flip-flops. 
Fortunately in living in Manhattan theirs 

24
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:47,92
a deli sort of underneath every building. 
To get to my deli, I had to go out the 

25
00:01:47,92 --> 00:01:49,560
front door, around the corner into the 
deli. 

26
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,274
And so out I went, money in hand, ready 
to purchase my 2 liter diet coke. 

27
00:01:54,274 --> 00:01:57,794
Walked into the deli, nodded hi to the 
guy behind the counter, went over to the 

28
00:01:57,794 --> 00:02:04,150
spot where the 2 liter Diet Coke was. 
But there was no 2 liter Diet Coke. 

29
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,801
I was taken aback. 
Empty spot where the 2 liter Diet Coke 

30
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:10,34
always was. 
So I leaned back to the fella behind the 

31
00:02:10,34 --> 00:02:12,538
counter. 
I said, hey, can you grab a couple of, 2 

32
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:16,326
liter Diet Cokes? 
And he said, I can still hear his accent 

33
00:02:16,326 --> 00:02:20,200
and everything in my mind. 
He said, I'm sorry. 

34
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,158
We're all out of 2 liter Diet Coke. 
Nothing could have been more horrible to 

35
00:02:26,158 --> 00:02:29,472
me at the time. 
I love my Diet Coke and I love my 2 liter 

36
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:32,984
Diet Coke. 
He followed up with an interesting 

37
00:02:32,984 --> 00:02:37,924
statement, which was, I'll give you 2 
1-liter bottles of diet coke for the same 

38
00:02:37,924 --> 00:02:42,548
price as a 2 liter bottle. 
I paused for a moment. 

39
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:47,150
I thought about it and I realized I 
didn't want 2 1-liter bottles of diet 

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:51,870
coke, I wanted a 2 liter bottle of diet 
coke. 

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,119
So I left in a little bit of a huff, 
walked out of the deli, walked up the 

42
00:02:55,119 --> 00:02:59,473
street. 
Now, I think I mentioned, it was quite 

43
00:02:59,473 --> 00:03:04,272
chilly and raining. 
I get up the block, go into the next 

44
00:03:04,272 --> 00:03:07,94
deli. 
In New York there's a deli every block. 

45
00:03:07,94 --> 00:03:11,50
went into the next deli, looked, no 2 
liter diet coke. 

46
00:03:11,50 --> 00:03:15,930
Went out another block, another deli, no 
2 liter diet coke. 

47
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,860
At this point, I had a decision. 
Do I give up? 

48
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,612
Do I walk the whole way across the avenue 
which is maybe a quarter mile, a half a 

49
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:25,930
kilometer, something like that, to a dip, 
to another deli. 

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,560
I did so, I got there, walked in. 
They had 2 liter Diet Coke, fantastic. 

51
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,190
I bought 6 bottles of it. 
Now I had 6 bottles, 3 in each hand. 

52
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,969
Walking back across Columbia campus, 
soaking wet, freezing cold. 

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,235
Arms pulling out of their shoulder 
sockets and I realized, something bizarre 

54
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:51,10
has just happened to me. 
What was it? 

55
00:03:51,10 --> 00:03:55,25
I was experiencing something that folks 
have called psychological reactance, and 

56
00:03:55,25 --> 00:03:58,820
reactance is the, basically the idea 
that, when something's restricted, when 

57
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:02,120
freedom of my choice is restricted, I'm 
going to fight really hard to get it 

58
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,441
back. 
In that particular instance, it was the 

59
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:11,796
first personal anecdotal experience I'd 
ever had of a psychological process 

60
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:16,553
overpowering me, taking over my actions, 
leading to some, somewhat [LAUGH] strange 

61
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:24,300
consumption behavior all outside of my 
conscious awareness and control. 

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,578
And, that sort of triggered this notion 
of for me, of understanding forces that 

63
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:32,546
occur outside our conscious control, that 
might be shaping our consumption 

64
00:04:32,546 --> 00:04:38,35
behavior. 
one of the interesting follow ups from 

65
00:04:38,35 --> 00:04:43,170
that, sort of basic observation and line 
of work we did, was realizing that 

66
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:48,542
oftentimes the trigger for a restriction 
of a freedom aren't nearly as obvious to 

67
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:57,0
you as the lack of a 2 liter Diet Coke in 
it's spot in the store. 

68
00:04:57,0 --> 00:05:00,481
So for example in a social domain we 
found that, and this is work with Amy 

69
00:05:00,481 --> 00:05:05,195
Dalton and Tanya Chartrand. 
Tanya, who happens to be my wife once 

70
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:09,290
observed that I often don't do the things 
that she would like me to do and I 

71
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,515
expressed surprise at that observation on 
her part, and we ended up doing some 

72
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:19,627
research on the topic. 
And what we found was that there are 

73
00:05:19,627 --> 00:05:23,592
certain people who chronically experience 
this notion of resistance to 

74
00:05:23,592 --> 00:05:29,420
restrictions, on an automatic basis. 
And I actually, what we found was that 

75
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,460
myself and people like me that don't like 
to have their freedoms restricted will 

76
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,428
actually restrict or will react against 
what their significant others would like 

77
00:05:39,428 --> 00:05:45,50
them to do. 
Your mom, your dad, your loved one, they 

78
00:05:45,50 --> 00:05:48,890
would like you to say, work hard, for 
example. 

79
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,180
Alright, all it takes for some folks is 
to hear in the way background, the little 

80
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,450
background back there, the name of their 
significant other. 

81
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:01,920
The name of their mom or dad. 
Instead of actually doing the things that 

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,400
their mom or dad or loved one would like 
you to do, like work hard. 

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,215
You actually do the exact opposite. 
Completely outside conscious awareness 

84
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,899
sometimes. 
It's such a strong effect that we were 

85
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,321
able to subliminally prime, and 
subliminal is Latin for sub, meaning 

86
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:20,724
below and liminal meaning threshold so 
below threshold. 

87
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:24,466
Subliminally prime people with the name 
of their loved one. 

88
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:28,498
So much so that, or below their level of 
awareness so we prime them below their 

89
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:32,734
level of awareness. 
So in a way that their sort of optical 

90
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:36,760
system and their brain can recognize the 
name of the significant other, but at a 

91
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:41,26
conscious level they are not able to do 
so. 

92
00:06:41,26 --> 00:06:44,834
so we activate in their minds the name of 
this significant other and then we put 

93
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:49,209
them in this situation where they could 
work hard or relax. 

94
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,867
For many people that experience 
psychological reactants on a regular 

95
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,857
bases. 
They actually backlashed against what 

96
00:06:55,857 --> 00:06:59,839
their loved one wanted them to do, and 
did the exact opposite. 

97
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,410
Back into a consumption setting, we take 
that same kind of notion. 

98
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,720
So now, some of us are, are sort of, 
bristle at restrictions, don't like 

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,44
people to tell us what to do. 
Some of you that are, are watching this 

100
00:07:14,44 --> 00:07:16,942
today might think to yourself, well I can 
sort of identify with that, I've about 

101
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:20,605
had it with people telling me what to do 
in certain spaces. 

102
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:25,193
So, some of you might have heard recently 
that you should, for example, eat 

103
00:07:25,193 --> 00:07:28,250
healthy. 
And I bet if you've heard eat healthy 

104
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,860
once you've heard eat healthy a thousand 
times. 

105
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,840
Or exercise. 
You should exercise more, right. 

106
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,540
And again if you've heard it once, you've 
heard it a thousand times. 

107
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,212
As you repeatedly get exposed to those 
message in your life, for some of us, we 

108
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:48,722
build up a resistance to that message. 
And in fact, we want to do just the 

109
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:51,930
opposite of that. 
And that was sort of the underlying 

110
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,190
premise of some work that Peggie Lou, 
who's a PhD student with with me, started 

111
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,20
doing, looking at what we call indirect 
priming, or indirect persuasion. 

112
00:08:02,20 --> 00:08:06,220
And so the idea here is that by 
sometimes, we're better to indirectly try 

113
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:10,560
to reach out to a person to a consumer 
and try to pursued them to do something 

114
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,328
that might be in their best interest by 
not triggering this backlash reaction. 

115
00:08:18,328 --> 00:08:21,592
And so for example if we want you to eat 
healthy we have found that it's actually 

116
00:08:21,592 --> 00:08:24,712
better to subliminally prime you with the 
message exercise, rather, then 

117
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,210
subliminally with the message eat 
healthy. 

118
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:34,69
If we subliminally prime you with the 
message eat healthy, some people will 

119
00:08:34,69 --> 00:08:40,450
actually not eat healthy, they'll 
backlash against it. 

120
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:44,232
And, and so we find that these indirect 
means to try to persuade folks, can 

121
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:49,612
sometimes be more effective then a direct 
in your face kind of message. 

122
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,324
So, when your thinking about trying to 
eat healthy, when your thinking about 

123
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:57,384
trying to exercise in your own sort of 
lives think about what are the triggers 

124
00:08:57,384 --> 00:09:01,96
in this environment that might lead me to 
outside of my conscience awareness 

125
00:09:01,96 --> 00:09:04,808
actually back lash against this message 
and do something that in the long run 

126
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:13,603
could actually quite be harmful to me. 
so those are little examples of this idea 

127
00:09:13,603 --> 00:09:19,828
that we can backlash against situational, 
environmental cues, in consumption ways, 

128
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:26,952
that will actually lead to outcomes that 
can be bad for us. 

129
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:30,734
obviously, if you sort of think 
classically from a, a traditional 

130
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:35,74
decision making, a traditional economic 
perspective, we would never do something 

131
00:09:35,74 --> 00:09:39,939
that would be bad for us. 
And I think most folks, if you asked 

132
00:09:39,939 --> 00:09:44,30
them, would not want to engage in these 
negative behaviors. 

133
00:09:44,30 --> 00:09:47,780
And yet, we find ourselves doing so. 
And I'll return and, and, and visit to 

134
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,860
this general idea that sometimes things 
occur outside conscious awareness that 

135
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:57,776
might not be so good for us in, in a bit. 
the second line of work that I thought 

136
00:09:57,776 --> 00:10:01,372
would be fun to, to talk about today is 
some work that we've done looking at, 

137
00:10:01,372 --> 00:10:06,958
what we call, brief brand exposures. 
And the ideal here is that we're exposed, 

138
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:12,480
the average consumer is exposed to many 
many brands in a paticular, in one day. 

139
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,231
So for example, most western societies, 
we're exposed to somewhere between 5 and 

140
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:23,794
10,000 brands in a day. 
And obviously that's far too many brands 

141
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:28,120
for us to consciously process in a 
meaningful way. 

142
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,139
so what happens? 
Does this simply, do they simply pass in 

143
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:35,892
front of us, a logo on someones shirt a 
thing on a co-, on a coffee cup. 

144
00:10:35,892 --> 00:10:40,862
or are they affecting us in some way, are 
they simply, you know, background noise 

145
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:46,695
or are they affecting us in some way? 
And one of the, the studies that we did 

146
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:51,505
to try to to sort of understand this this 
question, or to answer this question, was 

147
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:55,990
a study with with Tanya Chartrand and 
[UNKNOWN] Fitzsimmons where we looked at 

148
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,620
at different brief brand exposures. 
And the two that we'll tell you about 

149
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,126
today is Apple and IBM. 
So, we choose two brands that are in the 

150
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:09,961
product category, we then subliminally 
exposed people to one of each of these 

151
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,634
two brands. 
And, we then looked to see if it had an 

152
00:11:13,634 --> 00:11:16,899
effect on peoples behavior in some 
meaningful way. 

153
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,780
the domain that we looked at to test 
whether it was impacting behavior, was in 

154
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:27,28
the, the sort of field of creativity. 
And the ideal was, that the Apple brand 

155
00:11:27,28 --> 00:11:31,390
logo had very strong associations with 
creativity. 

156
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,141
Both Apple and IBM were equally liked, 
they were equally well-known, etcetera. 

157
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:39,970
but Apple had a really strong set of 
associations with creativity. 

158
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,234
So we exposed people to the brand logos 
outside their conscious awareness, and we 

159
00:11:43,234 --> 00:11:46,450
put them in a setting where they could be 
creative, where they could demonstrate 

160
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,366
creativity. 
And what we found, was that people 

161
00:11:50,366 --> 00:11:54,974
exposed to the Apple brand logo were 
dramatically more creative than people 

162
00:11:54,974 --> 00:12:01,847
exposed to the Apple or to the IBM logo. 
Apple exposed people way more creative, 

163
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:05,111
IBM exposed people slightly less creative 
than a neutral of situation in the 

164
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:08,705
middle. 
So here's a, there's a little example of 

165
00:12:08,705 --> 00:12:13,60
the simple incidental brand exposures 
that occur on a daily basis, thousands of 

166
00:12:13,60 --> 00:12:16,600
them. 
And each of them is impacting us 

167
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,570
potentially in some way changing our 
behavior. 

168
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,236
Now, if I asked you do you think you be 
got more creative because you saw that 

169
00:12:22,236 --> 00:12:25,948
Apple logo. 
I'm certain that everybody watching today 

170
00:12:25,948 --> 00:12:29,920
would say, no that seems crazy. 
That really seems silly. 

171
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,810
How can that possibly be the case? 
and yet, we have very clear empirical 

172
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,835
evidence that these brief exposures 
change both the psychological process, as 

173
00:12:39,835 --> 00:12:45,68
well as actual behavior. 
So, I've talked to you today about 

174
00:12:45,68 --> 00:12:48,908
backlash, and how backlash can occur 
outside our conscious awareness, 

175
00:12:48,908 --> 00:12:54,985
sometimes leading to harmful effects. 
I've talked to you about brief brand 

176
00:12:54,985 --> 00:13:00,510
exposures, IBM and Apple, that can lead 
to positive effects. 

177
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:04,734
When should be we terrified that we're 
being influenced outside our conscious 

178
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:10,650
awareness, left, right, and center. 
I think it's easy to become paranoid that 

179
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,730
that the world around you is trying to 
change your behavior. 

180
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,934
The truth of the matter is the world 
around you is trying to change your 

181
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:21,68
behavior. 
Some of it is very systematic, some of it 

182
00:13:21,68 --> 00:13:24,160
is not. 
I like to tell people when they think 

183
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,846
about unconscious consumption, that it's 
typically not the case that, for example, 

184
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:33,70
subliminal exposure to any kind of brand 
logo will make you choose that brand 

185
00:13:33,70 --> 00:13:37,981
logo. 
So for example I'm a Diet Coke drinker, I 

186
00:13:37,981 --> 00:13:41,182
love my Diet Coke. 
You could expose me to Diet Pepsi a 

187
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:44,734
million times in a row. 
I'll never choose Diet Pepsi over Diet 

188
00:13:44,734 --> 00:13:47,601
Coke. 
Alright, however, with exposure to Diet 

189
00:13:47,601 --> 00:13:51,259
Coke, whether it be through an ad, 
through watching someone walk by on a 

190
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:57,240
street with a Diet Coke lead me to want 
to consume a little more Diet Coke? 

191
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,77
The answer is proablay yes. 
So if you're trying to defend against 

192
00:14:01,77 --> 00:14:04,220
that we've got to be very vigilant, 
alright. 

193
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,124
The reality is though that our ability to 
defend against the non-conscience 

194
00:14:08,124 --> 00:14:11,910
influence in our environments is pretty 
limited. 

195
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,698
So I like to say and I like to, I'd like 
to leave you with this thought that it's 

196
00:14:16,698 --> 00:14:21,486
probably worthwhile investing in being 
strategic about the brands and the 

197
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:27,840
consumption objects you surround yourself 
with. 

198
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,669
So, for example, if you're a swimmer, and 
you'd like to really swim a faster race, 

199
00:14:33,669 --> 00:14:40,390
you'd like to cut a couple of tenths off 
your 50 meter swim. 

200
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,230
Maybe you should wear the same parka, on 
the warm up deck, that Michael Phelps 

201
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,997
wore. 
Now, the first day that you buy that 

202
00:14:47,997 --> 00:14:51,330
parka, and you put it on, you're going to 
feel silly. 

203
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,385
You're going to realize that you've got 
Michael Phelps' parka on, and clearly 

204
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:58,536
that can't make you a faster swimmer. 
The second day, you might still feel a 

205
00:14:58,536 --> 00:15:01,592
little of that. 
3 weeks out, you're not going to be 

206
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:06,148
consciously thinking about the fact that 
you're strategically donning Michael 

207
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:11,674
Phelps' warm-up jacket. 
But that association between the jacket 

208
00:15:11,674 --> 00:15:16,484
and Michael Phelps and how fast a swimmer 
he is, is going to be activated at some 

209
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:21,930
level below your conscious threshold in 
your mind. 

210
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:26,480
You hit the pool, you swim, you cut the 2 
10ths off. 

211
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,216
Same thing for creativity, for, for for 
intelligence, for just about any 

212
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:35,380
desirable aspirational goal you might 
have. 

213
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,624
Surrounding yourself with consumer goods 
that are strongly associated with that 

214
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:45,184
and activate that idea in your mind can 
lead you to to basically be a, a 

215
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:51,250
successful strategic user of brands, 
products, etc. 

216
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,408
Rather than letting you have brands, 
products, etc, change you are, who you 

217
00:15:55,408 --> 00:16:00,710
are and, and, and the way that you behave 
in a sort of random way. 

218
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,680
So think strategically, surround yourself 
with objects, with the brands, with the 

219
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,263
products that are going to make you a 
strategic unconscious consumer.
