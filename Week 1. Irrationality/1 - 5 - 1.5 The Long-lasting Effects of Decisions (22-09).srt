1
00:00:00,616 --> 00:00:06,688
When we think about the influence of the
environment on decisions, we can think

2
00:00:06,688 --> 00:00:10,464
that perhaps the environment will be like
waves.

3
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:16,964
That it will get people to decide one
thing one way, another thing another way,

4
00:00:16,964 --> 00:00:21,729
and so on, and things would move and
switch, and so on.

5
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:26,594
Or we can think to ourselves that maybe
what would happen is that once we make a

6
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,749
certain decision, that decision will stick
with us.

7
00:00:29,749 --> 00:00:32,316
And would disproportionately influence our
future decisions.

8
00:00:32,316 --> 00:00:37,536
Now I want us to think about what is the
role of our first decision in the category

9
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:42,500
on our future decisions in that category.
So I want you to think about the following

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,434
case.
How should people decide about buying

11
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:49,357
coffee?
What is the rational model that tells us

12
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:51,892
how we should decide if to buy coffee or
not?

13
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:55,920
And the rational model is very simple.
You have evaluation, how much you think

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,485
you would get from this coffee?
What kind of pleasure you expect to get

15
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:02,543
from this coffee?
And if the pleasure is high you would pay

16
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:06,515
more, if it's low you would pay less.
And for each amount of pleasure, you have

17
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:10,230
an associate amount of money.
So you say, how much pleasure do I expect

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,466
to get from this cup of coffee?
You say huh, $2.40.

19
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:18,430
If they charge me more, I will not pay.
If they charge me less, I would pay.

20
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,590
This is the standard rational model of
saying what is the, how much are we

21
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,200
willing to pay for coffee.
Now, that's a model that says that we

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,719
actually know how to evaluate coffee.
Instead, I want to propose something we

23
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,702
call self herding model.
And the self herding model is the model

24
00:01:35,702 --> 00:01:39,596
that says that we're influenced by our
past decisions as we make future

25
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:42,658
decisions.
So, first of all, let's think about,

26
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:45,955
what's herding?
Herding is the idea that we follow other

27
00:01:45,955 --> 00:01:48,486
people.
For example, imagine that you walk down

28
00:01:48,486 --> 00:01:51,229
the street, and you see two empty
restaurants.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,180
You don't know which one to choose.
You don't know anything about them.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,980
You pick one.
Somebody else comes after you.

31
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,450
They also know nothing.
But they see one restaurant with one

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:02,637
person, and one restaurant with zero.
What do they do?

33
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:05,772
They follow the herd.
They go to the restaurant with one person.

34
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,150
Somebody else comes.
They see a restaurant with two, they

35
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,560
follow that.
Another person comes, they see three, and

36
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,804
so on.
Eventually, one restaurant is a big hit.

37
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:17,829
One is a complete failure with no
information just because people tend to

38
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:20,615
follow other people.
Here's another example.

39
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:24,670
Sometimes there are fires in clubs or
other places that have lots of people.

40
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:28,741
And what happened in all of those cases
almost all of them, is that there

41
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:33,571
sometimes exits where people just run over
each other and kill each other as they try

42
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,838
to escape.
And other exits, nobody, nobody tried to

43
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,893
escape.
And you can think to yourself, what will

44
00:02:38,893 --> 00:02:41,224
happen?
Imagine that you're in a big room with

45
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:43,732
lots of people.
And all of a sudden, there are fire

46
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:46,597
alarms, and everybody's running in a
certain direction.

47
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:49,224
Are you going to stop?
Are you going to say, hey, let me stop,

48
00:02:49,224 --> 00:02:52,548
and let me see what people are doing.
Maybe there's something that everybody

49
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:55,960
else is missing.
Or you're willing to be inclined to try to

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,390
run after them and follow the herd?
Most likely you're going to try to follow

51
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,207
the herd.
The instinct is just incredibly strong.

52
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:07,322
So what is self-herding?
Self-herding is like herding but its

53
00:03:07,322 --> 00:03:11,530
herding that we follow ourselves.
You make one decision and you remember

54
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,470
what decision you make.
And therefore you like it to follow it and

55
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,760
follow it and follow it, and let me kind
of explain to you how this might look like

56
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,838
in coffee.
So imagine that it is 14 years ago or 15

57
00:03:22,838 --> 00:03:27,108
years ago and you live in Boston.
And every day, you get up in the morning

58
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:31,500
and you go to the office, and on the way
you stop at Dunkin' Donuts which is a

59
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,923
simple coffee shop, and you buy a cup of
coffee for $0.40.

60
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,607
And you go to the office and you're very
happy.

61
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:40,924
And you're used to that.
And one day, it's 4 o'clock in the

62
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:43,417
afternoon.
You're thirsty, you're tired, you need

63
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,662
coffee, and you also need to run some
errand.

64
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:49,963
You are going to run some errand, you
really feel like coffee, and you see this

65
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:52,250
new coffee place.
Let's say it's Starbucks.

66
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,337
And you have never seen Starbucks before
and you know nothing about them, but you

67
00:03:56,337 --> 00:04:00,424
really thirsty and you are tired and you
are a little aggravated and you walk into

68
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,869
Starbucks.
And you can't believe how much coffee

69
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,902
costs.
You've been paying $0.40 up to now and you

70
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:10,521
can't even imagine that coffee could cost
all of a sudden 2.50 and 3.50.

71
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:14,338
But you know what, you're there already,
you, you're really dying for coffee, and

72
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,500
you don't feel like walking four more
blocks.

73
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,477
So you're buying coffee there.
You go out, you go for your errands.

74
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:24,760
Three days later, you pass by this same
corner again.

75
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,660
What do you remember about your past
decisions?

76
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,500
Do you remember why you did it?
Do you remember your emotional states?

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,343
Do you remember how much in a hurry you
were, how much of a need of caffeine you

78
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:38,914
need, how much, how aggravated you were?
Of course not.

79
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,150
Three days ago at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon, how did you feel?

80
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,813
Do any of you remember?
Of course not.

81
00:04:44,813 --> 00:04:50,357
We have very bad memory for emotional
states, but we do remember our actions.

82
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:55,254
So in the same way you said to yourself, I
don't remember why, but I remember that

83
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:59,768
the past me from three days ago stood here
and made this decision to go into

84
00:04:59,768 --> 00:05:02,652
Starbucks.
Therefore, it must be a fantastic

85
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:04,947
decision.
I always make fantastic decisions.

86
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:07,990
Let me do it again.
And then you do it again, and again, and

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:11,167
again, and again.
And after a while, you stop thinking about

88
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:13,440
whether this was the right decision or
not.

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,832
You assume, in the same way that when you
have a long line of people, you assume

90
00:05:16,832 --> 00:05:20,292
that they know something.
When you have a long line of you making

91
00:05:20,292 --> 00:05:24,828
the same decisions in the past, you assume
that this was the right, the right

92
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:28,019
decision.
Now, here's an experiment to get us to

93
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:32,917
think about this, about how the role of
the first decision influence later

94
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,372
decision.
So I've done this many times, I come to a

95
00:05:35,372 --> 00:05:38,378
big group of people.
And I say, here are some products, for

96
00:05:38,378 --> 00:05:41,640
example.
A trackball, a keyboard a cheap wine, an

97
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,430
expensive wine, design book, and some
Belgium chocolates.

98
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,437
In experiments, we don't tell people how
much the wine cost.

99
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:52,603
We just describe the wine, the wine from
wine specter and wine magazine, and so on.

100
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:55,330
And we pass the products around.
So that everybody can look at them.

101
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,118
And examine them, and so on.
And then we say, okay, now that you know

102
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:03,020
all the products, here's a list, here's a
piece of paper with all the products.

103
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,644
And at the top, we ask you to put the last
two digits of your social security number,

104
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:12,712
of your national ID number.
And everybody puts the number, in my case

105
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:14,980
it would be 79.
People write these numbers.

106
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,015
And then we say, please take that number
and make it into a dollar amount.

107
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:23,303
So, in my case, it would be $79.
And write that amount in dollars next to

108
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:26,596
each of those items.
So people have numbers that end up in high

109
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:30,372
numbers, will write high numbers, people
that have numbers that end up in low

110
00:06:30,372 --> 00:06:34,156
numbers would write low numbers.
And then we say, hypothetically, would you

111
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:37,134
pay this amount in dollars for each of
those products?

112
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:40,739
And people say yes or no, yes or no,
hypothetically.

113
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:43,940
And then we say, and now, please submit a
real bid.

114
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,987
We're going to have an auction, we'll find
the highest bidders, they'll pay, they'll

115
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:50,510
get the products for real, but submit your
real bids.

116
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:55,762
People submit their real bids.
We find out who is the highest bidder.

117
00:06:55,762 --> 00:06:58,210
They pay.
We give them the product.

118
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:01,858
And we also ask people, we say, do you
think that your social security number,

119
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,047
these random two digits, had any
influence?

120
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,390
And people say, of course not.
But when we look at the results.

121
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:10,199
We find that they had a real big
influence.

122
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,350
And here's, kind of, an example from one
experiment.

123
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:18,672
When we look at people who had social
security numbers below 50, these are the

124
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:23,480
average prices they paid.
When we look at people that have ending

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,120
numbers bel-, above 50, these are the
numbers they had, and this is the

126
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,360
difference in percentages.
You see, it's quite, quite amazing.

127
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,460
Now, do people who give you Social
Security numbers know that you're going to

128
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,660
be willing to spend a lot of money or
spend very little money?

129
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,783
Of course not.
What happens is at the moment we get

130
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:48,287
people to consider a number, that number
stays in their mind.

131
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:50,300
It doesn't have to be social security
number.

132
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,980
It could be the weather.
It could be shoes.

133
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,654
It could be whatever.
In fact, the more random it is, the better

134
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:58,010
it is for the experiment.
But the moment you consider a number, that

135
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,628
number stays with you.
So, for example, you might say to

136
00:08:01,628 --> 00:08:07,212
yourself, hm, $79 for a bottle of wine.
No, that's too expensive, but maybe I'll

137
00:08:07,212 --> 00:08:10,464
pay 50.
And somebody that started with the number

138
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:14,260
12 maybe said, 12 for a bottle of wine?
Yes, I will do it, for sure.

139
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:17,018
How much more would I pay?
Well, maybe I'll pay 21.

140
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:22,034
So basically, people start with their
starting point, even if it's random, and

141
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,210
stay to, close to that.
Now, I should said that there was another

142
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,185
interesting pattern of the data.
Even though we could take each product and

143
00:08:29,185 --> 00:08:33,565
move it up and move it down, kind of
arbitrarily based on social security

144
00:08:33,565 --> 00:08:36,074
number.
And the relationship between them were

145
00:08:36,074 --> 00:08:38,817
quite good.
So, for example, everybody was willing to

146
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,470
pay more for the expensive wine than the
cheap wine.

147
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:44,930
We couldn't switch that.
Everybody was willing to pay more for the

148
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:49,165
keyboard than the trackball.
Once you pick a specific product, other

149
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:54,945
products in the same category follow a
particular trend and remains in a relative

150
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:58,983
good position.
But you can switch everything up and down

151
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:02,850
quite, quite easily.
And this is all about the role of the

152
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,980
first decision.
It suggests that once we make a first

153
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,335
decision, we remember that decision, and
that decision becomes, we call it an

154
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:13,377
anchor, a starting point for our future
decision.

155
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:21,527
This, of course brings to mind that famous
story from Tom Sawyer and Mark Twain.

156
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:27,210
And if you remember the story, the story
is that Tom Sawyer escaped from school and

157
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,089
went to the river.
And Aunt Polly caught him, and Aunt Polly

158
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:36,002
banished him to whitewash the fence.
And here it is, it's Sunday and Tom Sawyer

159
00:09:36,002 --> 00:09:39,941
is whitewashing the fence.
And his friend Billy the Steam is coming

160
00:09:39,941 --> 00:09:42,864
down from the hill and he's saying, poor
Tom Sawyer.

161
00:09:42,864 --> 00:09:47,390
You have to spend Sunday whitewashing the
fence and I am going to go to the river.

162
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,880
And Tom Sawyer doesn't move.
He continues to whitewash the fence.

163
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,220
And then Billy the Steam continues to make
fun of him.

164
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,509
And Tom Sawyer turns around to him and
says, What do you mean, 'poor Tom Sawyer'?

165
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,225
It's not every day that a kid gets to
paint a fence.

166
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:05,710
And Billy the Steam says, oh, you know,
that's kind of interesting.

167
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,120
Can I try?
And Tom Sawyer said, well, not so fast.

168
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,040
Aunt Polly's particular about who she lets
and who she doesn't let paint the fence.

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,018
It's kind of a special privilege, not
everybody can do it.

170
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:22,007
And then Billy the Steam says, what if I
give you my apple?

171
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:25,134
And Tom Sawyer says yeah, for that, that
seems like a good deal.

172
00:10:25,134 --> 00:10:29,154
And he lets him whitewash the fence for an
apple, and more and more friends come in

173
00:10:29,154 --> 00:10:33,179
and more and more of them are giving Tom
great treasures and all kinds of things.

174
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,220
And Tom Sawyer reflects on the day.
And he reflects on the fact that life is

175
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,276
not that bad after all.
And there's all kinds of things that you

176
00:10:41,276 --> 00:10:45,320
could you could do better.
But what Tom Sawyer and Mark Twain suggest

177
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:50,780
in this particular story, is that it's not
only that we can make something better and

178
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,170
something worse.
We can actually make something from being

179
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,638
positive from being negative.
Is white washing the fence an adventure,

180
00:10:58,638 --> 00:11:01,680
and something good that you should be
willing to pay for it?

181
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,220
Or it's something negative that you should
be paid for doing so.

182
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,778
Now, this of course, all kind of
interesting things in the market.

183
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:13,054
There are for example.
And people who go to prison to spend the

184
00:11:13,054 --> 00:11:15,610
night like in a hotel and they pay a lot
of money for it.

185
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,450
And there are vacations that you go to
work.

186
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:25,472
Where you go to become a farmer or you go
to squash wine or pick fruit or all kinds

187
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:28,199
of things.
There's all kinds of things that can

188
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,739
become from pleasure to work.
And it's, it's not really clear.

189
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,832
Now, we tried this version of Tom Sawyer.
We tried to see whether there was

190
00:11:36,832 --> 00:11:40,304
something we could move from being
pleasurable to displeasurable and the

191
00:11:40,304 --> 00:11:44,934
other way around.
And we choose to think of my ability to

192
00:11:44,934 --> 00:11:49,372
recite poetry.
So, so I came to a group of students.

193
00:11:49,372 --> 00:11:55,273
And I recited them a particular piece of
poetry from Walt Whitman's Leaves of

194
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:56,964
Grass.
[music].

195
00:11:56,964 --> 00:12:05,534
Whoever you are, holding me now in hand.
Without one thing, all will be useless.

196
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:12,150
I gave you fair warning, before you
attempt me further.

197
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,978
I am not what you suppose, but far
different.

198
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:23,900
Who is he that would become my follower?
Who would sign himself as a candidate for

199
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,815
my affection.
The way, suspicious.

200
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:33,597
The result, uncertain, perhaps
destructive.

201
00:12:33,598 --> 00:12:40,641
You will have to give up all else.
I alone will expect to be your sole and

202
00:12:40,641 --> 00:12:45,115
exclusive.
And after reciting the little bit of

203
00:12:45,115 --> 00:12:50,510
poetry, I said you know what?
On Friday, I'm going to have a poetry

204
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,783
recital.
And I'm going to have three poetry

205
00:12:53,783 --> 00:12:57,252
recital, short, middle length, and long
one.

206
00:12:57,252 --> 00:13:01,615
And then I said look, I don't have space
for all of you, this was a very big class,

207
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:05,346
I only have space for a few.
So I'm going to have an auction procedure

208
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:09,207
for you to decide who would get into the
recital and who would not.

209
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:13,564
And I gave people a sheet of paper to
submit their bids.

210
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:17,503
But for some people I said in the
beginning, before you start, tell me

211
00:13:17,503 --> 00:13:21,988
hypothetically whether you would be
willing to pay $10 to listen to Professor

212
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:26,620
Riales recite poetry for five minutes.
And they, they said yes or no, and then

213
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,610
they said how much they would pay for the
short, medium and long recital.

214
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,834
To other people, it was the same thing,
but we said hypothetically, before we

215
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:37,860
start, tell me whether you would be
willing to listen to Professor Rielli

216
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,684
recite poetry for five minutes if we paid
you $10.

217
00:13:40,684 --> 00:13:45,980
What happened?
The people who we asked them about willing

218
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,220
to pay, paying $10, were willing to pay.
The people we asked them about we paying

219
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,674
them, wanted to listen only if we pay
them.

220
00:13:53,674 --> 00:13:58,094
So what happened is that people don't know
if me reciting poetry is good or bad, and

221
00:13:58,094 --> 00:14:01,625
we can change their understanding based on
the first question.

222
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:05,400
And what about longer poetry reading?
They just went in the same direction.

223
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,235
So if somebody thought about it in the
negative direction, that they should be

224
00:14:09,235 --> 00:14:12,980
paid, then they thought they should be
paid for longer poetry reading more.

225
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,497
And if somebody thought it was positive,
they're willing to pay more for long po-,

226
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,918
poetry readings.
So the fact is that people don't know, for

227
00:14:20,918 --> 00:14:25,730
example here, if this is good or bad.
But once they decide, everything becomes

228
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:30,060
coherent, everything becomes sensible
within that, within that range.

229
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,402
Now, let's go back to Starbucks and
Dunkin' Donuts.

230
00:14:33,402 --> 00:14:39,082
Because if you think about first decision
influence later decisions, you could ask,

231
00:14:39,082 --> 00:14:43,577
how come Dunkin' Donuts did not influence
Starbucks' decisions?

232
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:48,889
If we had decisions about coffee, why
isn't my first decision about coffee at

233
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:53,557
$0.40 influencing my later willing to pay
for coffee at Starbucks?

234
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:58,315
And it, the point here is that Starbucks
did lots of things to get us not to think

235
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:02,642
about Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts as
decisions in the same category.

236
00:15:02,642 --> 00:15:08,836
Think about it.
When you go to restaurants and you look at

237
00:15:08,836 --> 00:15:11,640
the menu, do you compare things across
categories?

238
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,864
For example, have you ever looked at the
wine menu and said, my goodness, for the

239
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:20,088
difference in price between these two
bottles of wine, I can get four gallons of

240
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:23,195
milk?
Of course you don't, you don't think about

241
00:15:23,195 --> 00:15:25,935
other categories.
We compare appetizers to appetizers, and

242
00:15:25,935 --> 00:15:30,580
main dishes to main dishes.
Desserts to desserts, wine to wine, beer

243
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,247
to beer.
We don't compare even within the menu.

244
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:39,577
And what Starbucks wanted to ensure.
Is that we don't compare Starbucks coffee

245
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:42,660
to Dunkin Donuts coffee.
And how do they do it?

246
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,590
By all kinds of superficial by, important
things.

247
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:50,337
First of all, they did not start by
selling donuts and cookies and muffins.

248
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:53,568
Imagine the following case.
Imagine that Starbucks started and they

249
00:15:53,568 --> 00:15:56,280
created stores that were just like Dunkin'
Donuts.

250
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,485
The same design.
They sold everything, only the coffee was

251
00:15:59,485 --> 00:16:02,186
better quality.
How much more would you be willing to pay

252
00:16:02,186 --> 00:16:05,595
for coffee under those conditions?
If you could contrast them directly and

253
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:09,225
compare them, I'm betting that you would
not be willing to pay much more for that

254
00:16:09,225 --> 00:16:12,585
coffee.
But they basically wanted to separate the

255
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:16,740
decision as if it's wine and milk.
So they told this about single-bean

256
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,334
coffee.
And they told us about they sold us French

257
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,965
presses.
And there were no donuts and there were no

258
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:27,712
doughnut holes and there were no muffins.
There were only french and Italian

259
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:30,040
pastries.
And you couldn't ask for a small coffee.

260
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,896
If you asked for a small coffee they would
say, excuse me, I have no idea what you're

261
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:34,880
talking about.
We have all these other things,

262
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:43,427
mochaccino, frappuccino. And we, we only
have macchiatos and croissants and

263
00:16:43,427 --> 00:16:47,304
biscotti, and so on.
And because of that, because of all of

264
00:16:47,304 --> 00:16:50,464
these superficial things.
We did not compare the two directly.

265
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:54,130
And we were willing to treat Starbucks as
a new category of decision.

266
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:57,262
And accept whatever price.
They were offering to us.

267
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:01,780
Now, many years later, the decision to
spend more money on coffee, and the

268
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:05,064
decision to go into Starbucks is already
automatic.

269
00:17:05,064 --> 00:17:08,060
Now, we don't need to think about it.
It's something we just do without

270
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,750
thinking.
And because of that, now Starbucks can

271
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,856
change.
Starbucks can start selling us muffins and

272
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:17,766
cookies, and even donuts.
Something they couldn't have done in the

273
00:17:17,766 --> 00:17:21,384
beginning because of the separation they
can now do because we don't think about

274
00:17:21,384 --> 00:17:25,228
the decision so much.
This by the way also resonated very well

275
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:28,765
with what Conrad Lawrence showed many
years ago.

276
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:33,622
Conrad Lawrence was an amazing researcher
and he showed that if.

277
00:17:33,623 --> 00:17:39,151
Ducklings hatch what they do is they look
at the first figure in front of them and

278
00:17:39,151 --> 00:17:42,698
start following it.
And in fact for many of them Conrad

279
00:17:42,698 --> 00:17:46,555
Lawrence was that figure.
He was just waiting for the ducklings to

280
00:17:46,555 --> 00:17:49,877
hatch they observed him and then they kept
on following him.

281
00:17:49,878 --> 00:17:53,880
Its a really good analogy for how we think
about the first decision.

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,762
Its imprinted on us.
And then we're just making the same

283
00:17:57,762 --> 00:18:01,734
decision over and over without thinking
very much about it.

284
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:07,410
There's couples of ways to think about how
this idea of initial pricing influancing

285
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:12,127
later pricing, and influnce us in the
recent activities in the world.

286
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:13,980
So think for example about the first
iPhone.

287
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,754
When the first iPhone was introduced in
the US.

288
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:21,652
It was introduced at $600.
And very quickly, Apple said, sorry,

289
00:18:21,652 --> 00:18:25,879
sorry, sorry, it's only $400.
Was this a good pricing strategy or a bad

290
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:28,926
pricing strategy?
When I talked to the people at Apple, they

291
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:31,020
said, of course, it was a brilliant
strategy.

292
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,115
But let's think to ourself about what do
we think about this.

293
00:18:34,116 --> 00:18:37,642
So imagine two universes.
In one of them, the first iPhone is

294
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:41,309
introduced at $400 and the other one is
introduced at $600.

295
00:18:41,309 --> 00:18:46,331
And then very, very quickly, they said no,
no, sorry, sorry, sorry; it's only $400.

296
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:52,342
In which of those two universes would you
be more likely to buy the iPhone at $400?

297
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:54,742
Here's the thing, as a consumer, you have
this new device.

298
00:18:54,742 --> 00:18:57,170
And you have to figure out how much it's
worth.

299
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,772
Is it $20?
Is it $200?

300
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:02,527
Is it $600?
How much is it worth to you?

301
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,410
Very hard to figure out.
So now, think about it.

302
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,442
What happens in these two universes?
If it's $400, you have to really figure

303
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:14,466
out how much it's worth to you.
But if it went down from 600 to 400.

304
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,080
Now, all of a sudden, you could do a
relative comparison.

305
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,616
And even though the $600 is no longer
available, as long as it's available in

306
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:27,018
your memory, the contrast is still there.
And now, you say to yourself, it's two of,

307
00:19:27,018 --> 00:19:31,089
2 3rds of the price.
Clearly a good deal, now creating a much

308
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:34,563
better version.
It looks much more appealing.

309
00:19:34,563 --> 00:19:40,207
So when you do relative prices, relative
prices can be to things that are existing

310
00:19:40,207 --> 00:19:42,937
in the market.
But they could also be to phantom

311
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:46,719
products, things that used to be existed
in the market or exist only in your

312
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,417
memory.
Now, later on in the U.S.

313
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:53,651
Apple decreased the price of the iPhone
even further, and rolled the extra price

314
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,766
in to the monthly fee to the cell phone
companies.

315
00:19:57,766 --> 00:20:01,811
And then what happened?
Then they introduce the big iPhone, the

316
00:20:01,811 --> 00:20:04,520
iPad.
Now, what happens?

317
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,170
You have the same device without the phone
and only bigger.

318
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,408
You have the same screen, only bigger.
How much can you charge for it?

319
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:15,636
Well, how much you can charge for the iPad
has very little to do with the actual

320
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:19,274
value that it's giving.
And a lot to do with the relative size and

321
00:20:19,274 --> 00:20:23,407
the relative price.
Whatever you price the iPhone, the iPad

322
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:26,965
kind of tracks.
Not exactly per square inch, but it tracks

323
00:20:26,965 --> 00:20:30,290
in the relative similar ways.
And you know what?

324
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,439
All the other tablets have to follow the
iPad pricing as well.

325
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,011
We are relative, comparative creatures.
We're looking at price in relative way,

326
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:45,607
it's very hard for any product to come up
outside of this, of this comparison.

327
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:49,177
The same thing, by the way, can be said
about the internet, more generally.

328
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:52,886
When the internet started, we called this
internet zero point zero, there was a

329
00:20:52,886 --> 00:20:55,616
logic.
And the logic was, let's give everything

330
00:20:55,616 --> 00:20:58,754
for free.
And if we give everything for free people

331
00:20:58,754 --> 00:21:02,190
would come and, come and, come and, come
in masses and that was true.

332
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,882
And then they said and once people come in
masses and use our services they will get

333
00:21:06,882 --> 00:21:11,307
used to it and will want to use it and
they'll be willing to pay 19.95 for that.

334
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:16,732
That was not so true because when we
experience, experience something we might

335
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:20,242
value it.
But not necessarily be willing to pay for

336
00:21:20,242 --> 00:21:22,594
it.
And because of that, by the way, we move

337
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:26,949
to this internet as being an advertising
platform rather than a platform that

338
00:21:26,949 --> 00:21:30,228
people pay for it.
And the point here, the point I want you

339
00:21:30,228 --> 00:21:34,234
to think about is that once we make
initia, initial decisions.

340
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:38,545
Other decisions follow.
The way we train people to think initially

341
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:43,857
is most likely going to be the way that
they're going to make decisions later on.

342
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:49,722
It also suggests that when we introduce a
new product we have a tremendous latitude

343
00:21:49,722 --> 00:21:53,669
in how we want people to think about how
we can price it.

344
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:59,140
But once we've introduce it and people got
used to thinking about in a certain way,

345
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:02,332
it's really hard to escape that comparison
point.
