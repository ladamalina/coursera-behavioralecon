1
00:00:00,006 --> 00:00:02,593
Hello.
Hello.

2
00:00:02,593 --> 00:00:06,977
In this section, we're going to talk about
irrationality.

3
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:12,283
There's a little story that a father calls
his son and says, son, after 30 years of

4
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:16,197
marriage, your mother and I just decided
to get divorced.

5
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,350
And the son he say, well this is terrible.
This is awful.

6
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,725
I really don't want you to do it.
The, the son says, you know what?

7
00:00:22,726 --> 00:00:25,050
I'll come home.
Just, just don't do it yet.

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,720
Let's talk about it.
He says, you know what?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,880
I'll call my sister.
We'll be there the day after tomorrow.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Just don't do anything until we have a
discussion with you and Mom.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,047
And the father said, you know what?
I promise you.

12
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:38,348
We'll wait.
We'll see you the day after tomorrow, and

13
00:00:38,348 --> 00:00:42,110
then we'll have a discussion.
He puts down the phone.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,257
He turns to his wife.
And he says, darling, this year the kids

15
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:50,811
are going to come home for the holidays,
and they're paying for their own flight

16
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:55,145
tickets[MUSIC].
So when we think about irrationality, what

17
00:00:55,145 --> 00:00:57,930
is it about?
It's about the forces that drive our

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,586
behavior.
Some it are economic forces and some if it

19
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:05,169
are social forces.
And in this particular section we are

20
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:08,957
going to look at all kinds of influences
on our behavior.

21
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:11,120
We're also going to look at choice
architecture.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,254
We're going to look at how the world
around us and how it's structured.

23
00:01:15,255 --> 00:01:18,486
Changes how we view things and how we make
decisions.

24
00:01:18,487 --> 00:01:22,448
We're going to look at how initial
decisions are going to have long-term

25
00:01:22,448 --> 00:01:26,606
influence on us, and finally we're going
to think about what we could do to do

26
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:30,534
things better.
What can we do to try to overcome some of

27
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:56,452
our irrational tendencies.
I would like to argue, that when we think

28
00:01:56,452 --> 00:02:10,740
about irrational behavior.
This is something that is important, both

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,300
for our personal life, as well as our
social life.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,567
And as well as for our work life and, of
course, for policy.

31
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:20,184
And to get us started thinking about it, I
would like to tell you my own eh, personal

32
00:02:20,184 --> 00:02:24,976
case and how I became interested in.
When and under what conditions we behave

33
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:28,385
irrationally.
So as you can probably tell I was badly

34
00:02:28,385 --> 00:02:32,630
injured many years ago.
I was burned on about 70% of my body and I

35
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,784
spent about three years in hospital.
And hospitals give, gives everybody,

36
00:02:37,784 --> 00:02:42,866
everybody who spends time there many
opportunities to examine and think about

37
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:46,674
irrational behaviors.
And in my particular case there were lots

38
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:49,452
of examples.
But the thing that focused all my

39
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:54,468
attention, the thing that kind of eh, made
me think every day was the question of

40
00:02:54,468 --> 00:02:57,500
bandage removal.
So consider the following question.

41
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,468
Imagine you were, like me, burned in 70%
of your body and you were covered with

42
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:05,144
bandages, and every day the nurses had to
remove your bandages.

43
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,897
And ask yourself what is the right way to
remove these bandages?

44
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:11,330
And we can think about two very distinct
strategies.

45
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:16,720
One is to rip the bandages off, quickly as
possible, one after the other, minimizing

46
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,823
the duration of the treatment but making
each second of it incredibly painful.

47
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,604
The second approach is to rip the bandages
off slowly.

48
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:29,097
Take a long time but make each second less
painful.

49
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:34,672
Consider to yourself, which one of those
strategies would you pick?

50
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,510
Which one?
When I talk to people about this most

51
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,054
people say they would prefer the ripping
approach, and that's actually the approach

52
00:03:43,054 --> 00:03:46,238
my nurses liked as well.
I always, by the way, thought that the

53
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:50,240
reason they had this intuition that this
is a better approach is because that's how

54
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,685
they use to wax their legs.
Kind of in the ripping version.

55
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:57,604
But, removing hair is not the same as
removing bandages necessarily.

56
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:02,240
So, which one is the right approach?
As a patient, I used to feel that they

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,268
were not doing the right thing.
I used to argue with them and plead with

58
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:10,428
them and say, please, take more time, make
it slower, don't take, don't rip the

59
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,300
bandages as fast, but the nurses told me
two things.

60
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,130
The first they, they said was that they
were right.

61
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,166
They knew what is the best thing to do,
what would minimize my pain, right?

62
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:25,897
In some sense, they said, who are you, the
patient, to question our eh, judgement as

63
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:28,976
professionals.
And the second thing they said was that

64
00:04:28,976 --> 00:04:32,770
the word patient doesn't mean to butt in,
or intervene, or make suggestions.

65
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,131
It means to be passive and just sit there
eh, patiently.

66
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:41,656
In fact this was in Israel where I grew
up, but the word patient has this passive

67
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,174
component in any language I've seen so
far.

68
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:48,910
So the nurses kept on doing what they
thought was the best thing to do which was

69
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,720
to rip the bandages off quickly, and I
kept on complaining, and we kept on these

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,322
roles for quite a long time.
About three years later when I left the

71
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,514
hospital, I started studying at the
university, and one of the first

72
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:04,342
interesting lessons I learned was about
the power of the experimental method.

73
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:09,038
And what I particularly found interesting
is the idea that if you have a question,

74
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,687
about almost anything in life, you can
posit to an experiment.

75
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,750
You can say here is one version, here's
another version.

76
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,910
Let's see which one wins.
So I decided to try this out.

77
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,667
Now if you think about it, this question
about how people aggregate information

78
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:27,510
over time is very general.
Imagine that you have an axis.

79
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,930
You have time, and you have intensity, and
you have experience that can vary in

80
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,130
intensity in all kinds of ways.
You can have movies.

81
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:38,363
What could happen if we had a movie and we
had really good 5 minutes.

82
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:41,447
Are they better off in the beginning, the
middle or the end?

83
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:46,234
What if we can take an opera or a concert
and make it 10% longer or half an hour

84
00:05:46,234 --> 00:05:49,107
longer, are we making it better by how
much?

85
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:53,404
So these questions of how people take an
experience vary over time, and aggregate

86
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:58,200
information is actually quite general.
But for me, the main issue was pain.

87
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,397
I wanted to understand how this works in
the domain of pain.

88
00:06:02,398 --> 00:06:06,899
So initially, I didn't have much money for
research, so I went to a hardware store

89
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,547
and I bought a carpenter's vise, basically
something like this.

90
00:06:10,548 --> 00:06:14,580
And I set up this carpenter's vise in the
lab, and I invited people to come into the

91
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,660
lab and put two fingers in this device and
I would crunch people's fingers a little

92
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,972
bit.
And I would crunch their fingers a little

93
00:06:20,972 --> 00:06:24,220
bit for long durations and short
durations, high intensity and low

94
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,983
intensity.
Pain that goes up, pain that goes down, up

95
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,680
and down, down and up, all kinds of
versions of pain.

96
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:35,509
And after each of those painful experience
I would ask people and how painful was

97
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:40,142
that, and how painful was that.
This is kind of just rating scale from not

98
00:06:40,142 --> 00:06:42,920
painful at all to the most painful I can
imagine.

99
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,210
And then we ask people to make choices,
which one of the last 2 experiences would

100
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:51,370
you last to repeat, would you like to
repeat again, the last one or the one just

101
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,675
before it?
And people gave me their choices and their

102
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:59,378
ratings, and I were trying to infer how
people combine these experiences.

103
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:04,466
And I finished the first paper, I learned
some lessons, I published these in

104
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:07,528
academic journal.
And then good things happened, I got more

105
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,129
money for research, so I moved to better
equipment.

106
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,704
I move to something like this which are a
mechanism to create annoying sound, in

107
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:19,395
different intensities.
I did experiments with electrical shocks

108
00:07:19,395 --> 00:07:22,127
over time.
I even created a pain suit.

109
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:25,720
I created a suit with 300 feet of hoses
stitched thorough it.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,618
And with this suit, I could get people to
be very hot and very cold, and then I

111
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:33,797
could relieve that pain in many different
ways.

112
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:38,190
And what did I learn from all of those
experiences and all of those experiments?

113
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,837
I learned that the nurses got things wrong
in multiple ways.

114
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:48,025
First of all in the terms of the question
of duration versus intensity, it turns out

115
00:07:48,025 --> 00:07:53,050
that if you take an experience and make it
twice as long, you don't make it twice as

116
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,988
painful.
So the nurses were trying to minimize the

117
00:07:55,988 --> 00:07:58,840
duration, but they were not doing the
right thing.

118
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,431
On the other hand, when you play with the
intensity, you make something more

119
00:08:02,431 --> 00:08:05,258
intense.
Now you're really changing how people

120
00:08:05,258 --> 00:08:08,279
experience it.
So what the nurses were doing, they were

121
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,122
trying to minimize the duration at the
cost of the intensity, but by doing so

122
00:08:12,122 --> 00:08:15,790
they were not saving me much, but they
were making it much more painful.

123
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,817
And not just for me, by the way, for all
the other patients.

124
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:22,850
The second thing the nurses failed to
understand was that progression over time

125
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,435
matters a great deal.
When you start with the low pain, and you

126
00:08:26,435 --> 00:08:31,160
increase pain over time, this is much,
much worse than starting with the high

127
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,490
pain and going down over time, and mostly
for reason of convenience.

128
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,026
The nurses started at my legs, and ended
up in my face, which gave me the wrong

129
00:08:40,026 --> 00:08:44,368
progression of pain over time.
And, finally it turns out that for really

130
00:08:44,368 --> 00:08:48,557
long periods of pain it's good to give
people a period to kind of recover

131
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:52,414
recuperate and prepare themselves for the
next period of pain.

132
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:54,575
And, again this was something that the
nurse did not.

133
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:58,198
Get.
Now when I finished doing these

134
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:03,261
experiments about pain and pain
perception, aggregation of pain, I went

135
00:09:03,261 --> 00:09:07,664
back and I talked to the nurses.
All kinds of things have changed since

136
00:09:07,664 --> 00:09:11,751
then, but the thing that puzzled me the
most was how could the nurses get it

137
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,802
wrong.
Here were kind people, wonderful people

138
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:20,882
who were spending hours in terrible
conditions to serve their patients.

139
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,940
And they were not saying, you know, I
don't know which is the right way.

140
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,524
They were convinced that the right thing
to do was actually the thing that was

141
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:29,705
wrong.
It's not as if they say, I just don't know

142
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:33,799
what the right answer is.
No they actually had a strong conviction

143
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,827
that they knew waht the right answer is,
but that was not the right one.

144
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,616
And then of course the quesion is are
nurses the only people who have the wrong

145
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,212
intuition.
Are nurses the only people that says this

146
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:48,570
is what I think is the right answer when
in fact it's the wrong answer.

147
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,330
And from that point of view, and from that
starting point, I started looking at all

148
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:58,020
kinds of behaviors, all kinds of things in
which we have good intuitions, we have

149
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,990
good intentions, we trust our intuitions
but in fact, our intuitions are misleading

150
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,514
us time after time.
And this is for me kind of the starting

151
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:11,546
point of irrational behavior, things that
we think we know how they work, we think

152
00:10:11,546 --> 00:10:15,320
we know what's the right thing to do, but
in fact we're wrong.

153
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,610
So let's think about some of this.
Now to get you an intuitive example of how

154
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,740
these things work, without inviting you to
the lab and to eh, squish your fingers.

155
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,637
I want us to think a little bit about
visual illusions.

156
00:10:29,638 --> 00:10:34,284
So consider the following illusions.
You have two Towers of Pisa here, one on

157
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:38,070
the right and one on the left.
And now think to yourself, which one leans

158
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,060
more to the right?
If you're like everybody else on the

159
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,726
planet, you think that the one on the
right is leaning more.

160
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:53,028
But what about the following thing?
Now, again, if I asked you the same

161
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:59,058
question, again you would think the one on
the right is the one leaning more to the

162
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,964
right.
Now of course they'll just switched in

163
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:05,037
front of you and you know this is a visual
illusion.

164
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:09,327
Now what's interesting about visual
illusions is that everybody gets it wrong.

165
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:13,240
It doesn't matter how old you are, how
young you are, it doesn't matter how much

166
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,989
experience you have in vision, as long as
you can see you will get it wrong.

167
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:22,348
Here's another visual illusion, this is
one of my favorite all-time visual

168
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,502
illusions.
Look at this cube, the top arrow, to what

169
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:30,079
color is it pointing?
You probably think it's about brown.

170
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,431
What about the bottom one?
Well, looks orangish.

171
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:38,210
Turns out they are identical.
Can any of you see them as identical?

172
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,547
Of course not.
Now what happens if I cover the cube up?

173
00:11:42,548 --> 00:11:47,048
Now you can see that both of those patches
are actually identical, and by the way

174
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,997
there's no trick to it, these are really
identical.

175
00:11:49,998 --> 00:11:54,502
And here's the other interesting thing,
now the illusion pops right back.

176
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:58,865
Knowing that those two things are actually
the same doesn't help you in any way to

177
00:11:58,865 --> 00:12:02,987
see them as identical.
Now there's something else interesting in

178
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:08,347
this illusion, which we'll come back to
later, which is that this illusion is all

179
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:11,501
about the way that the brain uses
relativity.

180
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:15,414
Many times what you think to yourself
you're doing, is you're comparing the top

181
00:12:15,414 --> 00:12:19,190
patch to the bottom patch, but that's
actually not what your visual system is

182
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:21,306
doing.
What the visual system is doing is

183
00:12:21,306 --> 00:12:25,522
comparing the top patch to its immediate
environment and the bottom patch to it's

184
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,050
immediate environment, and because of that
you get this illusion.

185
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,560
You think to yourself that you can compare
both patches correctly, but you can't.

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,510
When we come back to it you'll see how it
comes about this illusion in all kinds of

187
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,085
other areas of life, including pricing,
for example, and how we're using

188
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:48,387
background context to evaluate and think
differently about what we're comparing.

189
00:12:48,388 --> 00:12:51,984
There's one more type of illusion I want
to eh, share with you, and I'm going to

190
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:56,082
show you a couple of examples of those.
And it's a different kind of illusion

191
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:58,847
because it only works once, so pay
attention.

192
00:12:58,847 --> 00:13:03,010
So in the next clip, what you're going to
see is a group of people holding iPads,

193
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,177
and they're going to move the iPads, and
the iPads are going to change colors.

194
00:13:07,178 --> 00:13:11,937
And your task is to count how many times
they change into the color red.

195
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:16,220
Every time something change from one color
to red to something else, you count it and

196
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,620
then another iPad changes to red, you
count it.

197
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,704
And your task is to count how many times
all the iPads Across the whole clip,

198
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:27,862
change into red colors.
Now, don't get too technical, if something

199
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:31,933
looks almost like red or slightly pinkish,
it's okay, count it as red.

200
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,938
Okay?
So, before we go though, I do want to say

201
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:38,451
a couple of things.
First of all, it turns out that there's a

202
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,867
lot of research about it, showing that
people who do well on this task, people

203
00:13:42,867 --> 00:13:46,562
who count well on this task, do well in
terms of their love life.

204
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:51,571
They have better, better romantic life.
And the second thing is the people who do

205
00:13:51,571 --> 00:13:55,390
well on these tasks, live longer.
So if I were you, I'm just saying, if I

206
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:00,354
were you I would focus, I would count well
because remember what's on the line here

207
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:03,117
is your romantic future and your
longevity.

208
00:14:03,118 --> 00:14:09,430
So count carefully how many times the
people, how many times the people, the

209
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,180
iPads are switching into red color.
Ready.

210
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:18,612
Set.
Go.

211
00:14:18,613 --> 00:15:11,058
[music] So how many did you count?
Count 50, 60, 70, 40, 20?

212
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:15,024
How many?
The real number is 62 but the reality is

213
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:19,688
that, that doesn't matter so much.
The reason I really asked you this

214
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:25,196
question was not to ask you how many times
the iPads are flashing red, but to ask you

215
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:30,461
a slightly different question which is,
did you notice, me in a particular bee

216
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:35,210
suit, hovering around the scene?
Did you notice me at all, or not?

217
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:38,334
Let's look at it again.
And this time try to pay careful

218
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:42,430
attention, not to the iPads, but to the
total scene, and let's see if this time

219
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,881
you can see me floating around.
[music] And just to be clear, this is the

220
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:52,520
same exact clip.
And if you don't believe me, luckily you

221
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,312
have the video.
Go back and you can look at the first clip

222
00:15:56,312 --> 00:16:01,045
again just to prove it to yourself beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

223
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:37,089
[music] I hope, that like me, you find
this quite startling.

224
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:42,011
You look at a small part of the screen.
You focus, you look very carefully, and

225
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:47,324
nevertheless something unexpected happens
around the screen, and you're able to

226
00:16:47,324 --> 00:16:50,266
ignore it.
It's a tremendous ability of human,

227
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:55,000
capacity and the reason for that by the
way, is that we don't see with our eyes.

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,655
We see with our brains.
Our brains expected to see a particular

229
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:02,950
pattern and that's what we end up seeing.
Now we think we see with our eyes.

230
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,180
We think that we observe all the
information, but we don't.

231
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,590
And just as another example of that, do
you remember what shirt I was wearing

232
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:14,262
before we started this clip?
Well, you can go back and check for

233
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:19,372
yourself, but I have a different hair cut,
slightly different shave, actually very

234
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,432
different shave.
Well, slightly different shave, and a

235
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:26,100
different shirt.
And I bet you didn't notice those changes

236
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,209
either.
I hope you agree with me that it's really

237
00:17:29,209 --> 00:17:32,687
kind of amazing to see how much we don't
pay attention.

238
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,964
You know, we usually think that we see
with our eyes, but the reality is, we see

239
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:39,230
with our brains.
And our brains fill in the information in

240
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,505
the way that we expect to see it, not
necessarily what it is out there,

241
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:48,111
actually, but what we expect to see.
Now why do I start with talking about

242
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:53,052
decision making irrational behavior, by
talking about visual illusions?

243
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:56,960
I think visual illusions are a great
metaphor that help us to think about human

244
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,954
thinking.
Think about it.

245
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:02,040
We have a huge part of our brain dedicated
to vision.

246
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,132
We have a huge part here in the back
dedicated to vision, does vision all the

247
00:18:06,132 --> 00:18:09,867
time, bigger part of the brain that is
dedicated to anything else.

248
00:18:09,868 --> 00:18:13,710
We do vision many hours of the day.
We've evolutionary design to do vision.

249
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,910
If you had to pick one thing that people
are good at, it's vision.

250
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,676
And nevertheless we have these mistakes.
You'll always see the Pisa illusion,

251
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:27,425
you'll always see the cube illusion.
And the question we should ask ourselves,

252
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:31,780
if with all these benefits, huge
mechanism, lot of experience, evolutionary

253
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:35,867
reasons to do it, with all of those
reasons to do vision well, we still have

254
00:18:35,867 --> 00:18:40,624
predictable systematic mistakes in vision,
what are the odds that we don't have even

255
00:18:40,624 --> 00:18:44,948
more mistakes in other areas of our lives?
What happened to decisions about health

256
00:18:44,948 --> 00:18:46,860
care?
Decisions about money?

257
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,292
Those are areas where we don't have a
particular brain mechanism, we don't have

258
00:18:50,292 --> 00:18:53,330
that much experience.
Evolutionary these are much newer things.

259
00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,406
Couldn't it be that in those areas we
would have even more predictable and

260
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:08,877
systematic mistakes that everybody shares?
And for the rest of the discussion I want

261
00:19:08,877 --> 00:19:15,395
to present to you the case that this is
indeed, this is indeed so.
