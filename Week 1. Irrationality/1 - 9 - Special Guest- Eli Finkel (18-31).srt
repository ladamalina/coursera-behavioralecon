1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,506
My name is Eli Finkel, I'm a professor of 
psychology at Northwestern University. 

2
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:14,25
And I'll be presenting some research that 
has been spearheaded by Paul Eastwick, a 

3
00:00:14,25 --> 00:00:17,340
former graduate student of mine who is 
now a professor at Texas, at University 

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,72
of Texas. 
And the title of the talk is the delusion 

5
00:00:21,72 --> 00:00:24,830
of romantic self-insight. 
And I want to talk about how dating has 

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,2
changed in the Internet era, and in 
particular, I want to talk about online 

7
00:00:28,2 --> 00:00:31,304
dating. 
One of the major assumptions of online 

8
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:35,180
dating is that we can look at profiles of 
potential romantic partners and discern 

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,260
from reading those profiles who is 
romantically compatible with us. 

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,677
So, if that's true, that we have insight 
into our preferences, and can tell who's 

11
00:00:43,677 --> 00:00:46,941
compatible with us, then this is an 
outstanding way that we could go about 

12
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:52,250
selecting our romantic partner or at 
least reducing the size of the pool. 

13
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,2
But if it's not true that we have insight 
into our romantic preferences, then not 

14
00:00:56,2 --> 00:00:59,586
only are we wasting a great deal of time 
by browsing all these profiles, but we 

15
00:00:59,586 --> 00:01:02,890
are also limiting or ruling out people 
from the dating pool who might be 

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:08,700
especially compatible with us. 
And so, what I'll do today is talk about 

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,0
the degree to which we have accurate 
insight into our romantic preferences and 

18
00:01:12,0 --> 00:01:15,710
this question boils down to two distinct 
questions. 

19
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:19,244
The, the first one is, are there sex 
differences in what people are looking 

20
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:23,577
for in a potential romantic partner? 
And, and the short answer to that is of 

21
00:01:23,577 --> 00:01:26,336
course there are. 
Men are especially interested in looks, 

22
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,180
much more then women are. 
Women are especially interested in 

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,697
earning prospects, more then men are. 
Those are widely replicated sex 

24
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:34,943
differences. 
I want to probe a little deeper and find 

25
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:38,210
out whether those sex differences hold up 
when it really matters. 

26
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,420
And the second question I have doesn't 
involve sex differences. 

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,388
It says, we as individuals, to what 
degree do we have accurate insight into 

28
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:49,960
what it is that tends to inspire our 
romantic attraction? 

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,750
If we do have good insight, then browsing 
profiles is a great way to go about 

30
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,486
finding a partner. 
If we don't, then we really should 

31
00:01:55,486 --> 00:01:58,216
probably meet face-to-face to get a 
chemistry check of who's compatible with 

32
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,871
us. 
Let's start by talking about sex 

33
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,644
differences. 
There are large sex differences in stated 

34
00:02:04,644 --> 00:02:07,857
preferences, that is, if you ask people 
to what degree do you value a certain 

35
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:11,223
series of characteristics, many things 
men and women agree on, we all like warm 

36
00:02:11,223 --> 00:02:16,445
partners kind partners, etcetera. 
But there are two massive sex differences 

37
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:19,504
that I mentioned earlier. 
The first is physical attractiveness, men 

38
00:02:19,504 --> 00:02:22,452
like that more than women, the second is 
earning prospects, women like that more 

39
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:26,302
than men. 
But, before we conclude that these sex 

40
00:02:26,302 --> 00:02:30,328
differences are totally universal, let's 
first examine a little bit about the 

41
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:36,120
research paradigms that people have used 
to try to establish those effects. 

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,288
One of the major research programs or 
research paradigms is to ask people about 

43
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,815
hypothetical partners. 
Specifically, ask them to what degree are 

44
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:45,875
you looking for somebody who posses 
characteristics like good earning 

45
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:50,196
prospects or a good earning potential. 
And you see the sex differences there, 

46
00:02:50,196 --> 00:02:54,80
men want looks more than women do, women 
want earning prospects more than men do. 

47
00:02:54,80 --> 00:02:56,870
A second paradigm as you look at the 
effects of physical attractiveness in 

48
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,596
people depicted in photographs. 
So when you're evaluating photographs, 

49
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:03,928
men are more inspired by the attractive, 
relative to the unattractive women more 

50
00:03:03,928 --> 00:03:07,358
than, more than women are attracted to 
the, attractive versus the unattractive 

51
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:10,726
men. 
And the best research looks at personal 

52
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:13,606
ads or online dating profiles, and 
specifically, what we see in those is 

53
00:03:13,606 --> 00:03:16,966
that men tend to advertise things about 
themselves oriented toward demonstrating 

54
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,990
their earning prospects, women tend to 
accentuate things related to their 

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,890
physical attractiveness. 
And when men and women respond to 

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,600
personal ads or online dating profiles, 
they tend to be differentially influenced 

57
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,140
in a way that's consistent with all those 
other sex differences. 

58
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,621
But I have a question, what about after 
men and women have actually met a 

59
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:41,130
significant other, a another person 
face-to-face, right? 

60
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,875
Do these sex differences that hold up so 
well in all those paradigms we've 

61
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,890
discussed already, continue to hold up 
once you've met an actual flesh and blood 

62
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,108
person? 
Well, one empirical approach, one method 

63
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:56,20
that we can use to start unpacking that 
question is speed dating. 

64
00:03:56,20 --> 00:03:58,596
And so, Paul Eastwick and I at 
Northwestern University, ran a whole 

65
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:03,0
series of speed dating events. 
I, in fact, served as MC of these events. 

66
00:04:03,0 --> 00:04:06,850
And the way speed dating works is, is 
these were heterosexual events we had 12 

67
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,416
men and 12 women attend each event. 
So if you're a man, you would go on a 

68
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,310
4-minute date with each woman and then 
the MC, I in this case, would blow a 

69
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,960
whistle and you would rotate to the next 
person. 

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,480
Alright, so the way it works is that all 
of the men went on 4-minute dates with 

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,40
all the women, all the women, of course, 
went on 4-minute dates with all of the 

72
00:04:25,40 --> 00:04:29,140
men. 
And what we were able to do with this 

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,660
method is we were able to look at the 
degree to which physical attractiveness 

74
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,345
and earning prospects actually predict 
romantic attraction to flesh and blood 

75
00:04:36,345 --> 00:04:41,480
partners you have met in person. 
And one of the things we wanted to do is 

76
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,200
establish from the very outset that are, 
that there was nothing strange about our 

77
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,204
sample of participants. 
So before they attended the speed dating 

78
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,825
event, they reported about a week earlier 
on their preferences, the standard, sorts 

79
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:56,323
of measures that people regularly use. 
To what degree are you interested in 

80
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:59,573
somebody, to what degree is it important 
to you that a potential partner is 

81
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:02,573
good-looking or has good earning 
prospects or is highly personable and 

82
00:05:02,573 --> 00:05:07,116
kind and warm? 
And as you can see here in the graph men 

83
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:10,234
care more than women about physical 
attractiveness. 

84
00:05:10,234 --> 00:05:13,430
Again, this is on the, the questionnaire 
that our speed daters completed the week 

85
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,770
before they attended the lab session, the 
speed, the speed dating even rather. 

86
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,524
Women cared more about earning prospects 
than men do. 

87
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:23,774
And men and woman, as has been shown in 
previous research, care about, equally 

88
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:26,900
about how warm and kind a potential 
partner is. 

89
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,300
So here we are replicating the, the same 
effects that everybody else replicates, 

90
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,110
except we wanted to do something 
different. 

91
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,192
We wanted to take these same people, who 
showed these standard sex differences, 

92
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:39,136
and then introduce them to flesh and 
blood partners through the speed dating 

93
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,107
event. 
And here, in this graph, you're going to 

94
00:05:42,107 --> 00:05:46,140
see some different information. 
What you see on the y-axis is you see the 

95
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:51,110
correlation of, of, of an attribute, the 
physical attractiveness for example, with 

96
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:55,650
attraction, right? 
And so the idea should be that the more 

97
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,550
the higher the correlation that you're 
going to see here, means the more 

98
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,451
strongly that characteristic iInspires 
romantic attraction to the person. 

99
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:06,551
And what you can see is, here are the 
effects for physical attractiveness, 

100
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:10,260
correlation is in about the 0.4 range, 
but no sex difference. 

101
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,55
The degree to which romantic physical 
attractiveness inspires your romantic 

102
00:06:14,55 --> 00:06:18,930
attraction is equally strong regardless 
of whether you're a man or a woman. 

103
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,850
Now, let's turn to earning prospects. 
Here, you can see that in general, 

104
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,775
earning prospects are a little bit less 
important in this sample than than 

105
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:27,475
physical attractiveness is, the 
correlations are in the, you know, 0.2 

106
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:31,142
range. 
But, what you can see is, once again, the 

107
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:34,390
correlations are equally strong for men 
and women. 

108
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:37,142
None of these correlations was anywhere 
close to statistic, statistically 

109
00:06:37,142 --> 00:06:40,50
significant. 
And personable is also pretty attractive, 

110
00:06:40,50 --> 00:06:43,100
somewhere in between physically 
attractive and earning prospects, and 

111
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,526
once again, no sex difference. 
Now, you might think, I hear you 

112
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,910
thinking, right, so come on that's just 
one study. 

113
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,188
This is a very surprising effect. 
Could it really be the case that men and 

114
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,337
women don't actually have different 
preferences for physical attractiveness 

115
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:59,130
or earning prospects once they meet a 
flesh and blood partner? 

116
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,378
So what we wanted to do is we, we wanted 
to conduct a meta-analysis, and 

117
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:05,850
specifically, what that means Is we track 
down every single published and 

118
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:09,546
unpublished article that has looked at 
people who have met face-to-face with a 

119
00:07:09,546 --> 00:07:13,130
potential partner and reported on that 
partner how attracted they are or how 

120
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,740
satisfied they are. 
This also includes not only initial 

121
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,908
attraction, but also in your marriage, 
how satisfied are you and committed are 

122
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:25,847
you to the marriage, etcetera. 
But they have to report on a specific 

123
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,179
person they've met face-to-face, not on 
some hypothetical person who might be an 

124
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:32,918
ideal partner for them. 
The dependent variable that I was 

125
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:36,710
suggesting earlier is, is an amalgam, a 
combined sort of measure, right? 

126
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:40,238
So, in an initial attraction context, 
it's things like romantic liking, or 

127
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:44,312
attraction, or sexual desire. 
In marriage, for example, you'll see 

128
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:49,574
things like relationship satisfaction or 
how much you love your partner, etcetera. 

129
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:53,370
And study, the other criterion we needed 
to include studies in this meta-analysis, 

130
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,802
include articles in this meta-analysis, 
was that it had to have some measure of 

131
00:07:56,802 --> 00:08:01,0
physical attractiveness, earning 
prospects, or both. 

132
00:08:01,0 --> 00:08:03,510
And some of these measures are the 
participant's report. 

133
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:06,194
So if I'm reporting how attracted I am to 
you or how satisfied I am in our 

134
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,54
marriage, then it could be my report of 
how good-looking you are or my report of 

135
00:08:09,54 --> 00:08:12,800
your earning prospects. 
It could be your report, so how 

136
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,652
good-looking do you think you are or how 
good, how promising you think your 

137
00:08:15,652 --> 00:08:19,524
earning prospects are or it could be an 
objective assessment. 

138
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,710
For example a consensus rating of a 
photograph of you in terms of how 

139
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,880
attractive you are or a measure of how, 
what your actual income is, right? 

140
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,970
So we, we look at all of those different 
types of measures. 

141
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,574
Now, for physical attractiveness, we were 
able to find 73 articles with a total of 

142
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:38,344
28,000 participants. 
For earning prospects, we were able to 

143
00:08:38,344 --> 00:08:41,844
track down 44 articles with about 46,000 
participants. 

144
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:44,616
So, these are large samples, they really 
put us in a good position to test, is 

145
00:08:44,616 --> 00:08:47,784
there a difference between men and women 
and their earning prospects and can we 

146
00:08:47,784 --> 00:08:51,340
detect a statistically significant 
difference? 

147
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,60
We've got a lot of ability to do that in 
a sample this large. 

148
00:08:54,60 --> 00:08:56,902
And what you see here, again, on the left 
side of this graph is physical 

149
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:00,234
attractiveness, on the right side, you 
see earning prospects and once again, you 

150
00:09:00,234 --> 00:09:05,30
see nothing close to a statistically 
significant difference. 

151
00:09:05,30 --> 00:09:07,872
So again, the take home message, not only 
from the speed dating work at 

152
00:09:07,872 --> 00:09:11,106
Northwestern, but from the full corpus of 
evidence that exists anywhere in the 

153
00:09:11,106 --> 00:09:15,50
world on this topic. 
That physical attractiveness, big 

154
00:09:15,50 --> 00:09:18,250
correlate of how attractive you are to 
people, big correlate of how happy you 

155
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,660
are in your marriage, but not 
differentially for men and women. 

156
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,116
Earning prospects, a less significant 
predictor of initial attraction and 

157
00:09:26,116 --> 00:09:31,0
satisfaction in your marriage, but once 
again, not different for men and women. 

158
00:09:31,0 --> 00:09:33,70
Now, this raises a different set of 
questions, right? 

159
00:09:33,70 --> 00:09:36,727
So the first set of questions were, well, 
are there really sex differences in these 

160
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:40,120
things that we assume to be sex 
differentiated? 

161
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,788
And the evidence now appears to be 
overwhelming that there are not sex 

162
00:09:42,788 --> 00:09:47,110
differences in those mate preferences 
once you meet a flesh and blood partner. 

163
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,260
Now, the question is, well, what's going 
on? 

164
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:52,204
If those same people who reported a week 
ago that they really cared a lot about 

165
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:55,194
earning prospects and they cared less 
about physical attractiveness, then a 

166
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:58,276
week later meet a series of people in the 
flesh and blood, a series of speed dating 

167
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:02,871
partners, for example. 
And they don't show those sorts of sex 

168
00:10:02,871 --> 00:10:05,815
differences that exhibited, that they 
exhibited a week earlier, there's an 

169
00:10:05,815 --> 00:10:08,943
interesting question that emerges from 
that, which is do people really know what 

170
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:13,385
they want in the first place? 
And this harken, harkens back, of course, 

171
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:16,630
to the online dating question, the 
profile browsing question. 

172
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,595
So, ignoring sex differences, do people 
who believe they value a certain 

173
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:25,360
characteristic actually prize it more 
than other people do? 

174
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,777
And so, what we wanted to look at here is 
the, the correspondence between what you 

175
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:31,786
said you cared about in a romantic 
partner, a week ago, and the degree to 

176
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:35,50
which that characteristic actually 
inspires your attraction once you meet 

177
00:10:35,50 --> 00:10:39,433
face-to-face. 
And, if you look here in the, in this 

178
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:42,835
first graph on the upper left, what you 
see is how physically attractive the 

179
00:10:42,835 --> 00:10:48,480
partner is that you're rating. 
And this black line represents people 

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,8
who, who said that physical 
attractiveness was extremely important to 

181
00:10:52,8 --> 00:10:54,660
them. 
So, you can imagine, people vary in the 

182
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,140
degree to which they say physical 
attractiveness is important, these are 

183
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,90
people who said, yes, it's extremely 
important to me. 

184
00:11:00,90 --> 00:11:03,290
And not surprisingly, you see a strong 
positive correlation such that as the 

185
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,490
person you're rating goes from low 
attractiveness to high attractiveness, 

186
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,220
there on the x-axis. 
The amount of romantic attraction you 

187
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,890
experienced for the person goes up 
sharply. 

188
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,800
Now, this is crucial. 
If it's the case that people who say, I'm 

189
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,550
actually not that interested in romantic 
attraction, it doesn't actually matter 

190
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,950
I'm sorry, in physical attractiveness, 
that is, it doesn't actually matter that 

191
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,649
much to me, then you should be, see a 
weaker slope, maybe something like this. 

192
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,798
And what that slope would suggest, given 
that it's, that it's not parallel to the 

193
00:11:31,798 --> 00:11:34,473
black slope. 
What you see here is, yes, of course, 

194
00:11:34,473 --> 00:11:37,463
it's nice to be with somebody better 
looking than somebody worse looking, but 

195
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,545
the level of attraction is less strong of 
a predictor among people who say I don't 

196
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:45,968
care about physical attractiveness. 
But that's not what the data show. 

197
00:11:45,968 --> 00:11:50,70
This is what the data show, an exactly 
parallel line. 

198
00:11:50,70 --> 00:11:53,172
What that means is regardless of what you 
told us a week ago of the extent to which 

199
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:57,440
physical attractiveness is important to 
you in a mate. 

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,36
The degree to which you like the 
attractive people more than, more than 

201
00:12:00,36 --> 00:12:03,762
the unattractive was the same. 
Everybody was about equally inspired by 

202
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:07,313
the, by the degree to which the person 
was attractive and their previous reports 

203
00:12:07,313 --> 00:12:10,599
of how much they thought physical 
attractiveness would matter to them was 

204
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:14,340
irrelevant. 
How about earning prospects? 

205
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,81
Over here on the upper right, you can see 
that graph, and what do you see? 

206
00:12:18,81 --> 00:12:20,388
Two parallel lines. 
People who say they care a lot about 

207
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:23,470
earning prospects, people who say they 
don't care much about earning prospects 

208
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,414
end up being equally inspired by the 
people with high relative to low earning 

209
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:29,906
prospects. 
Over here on the lower left, now we have 

210
00:12:29,906 --> 00:12:33,410
personable, how warm and kind and 
friendly is the person? 

211
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,363
Once again, two parallel lines regardless 
of how personable you said you wanted 

212
00:12:37,363 --> 00:12:40,962
your, how, how important it was for you 
that romantic partners are high in 

213
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:45,151
personability, was irrelevant to how much 
high versus low personable people matter 

214
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:48,77
to you. 
Now, is this a statistical artifact, or a 

215
00:12:48,77 --> 00:12:51,933
statistical confound in our design? 
Is it the case maybe that people don't 

216
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:58,80
actually have any preferences for 
anything? 

217
00:12:58,80 --> 00:13:01,986
Well, we want to suggest that the story 
is very complicated for mating, for a 

218
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:07,459
variety of reasons, one of which is, 
mates vary on a lot of dimensions. 

219
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,550
People are very complicated, much more 
complicated than say, a sofa. 

220
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,88
But also, the mate has to like you back 
and these things all factor into the 

221
00:13:14,88 --> 00:13:17,130
evaluation. 
So we did a final little quirky study 

222
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,298
where, where what we wanted to do was see 
whether we could find evidence for this 

223
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:23,562
predictive validity hypothesis, for this 
hypothesis that, when you say you care 

224
00:13:23,562 --> 00:13:26,490
about something, you actually are 
inspired by that thing and we looked at 

225
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,929
cereals. 
Specifically, we looked at the sugar 

226
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,164
content of cereals. 
People vary in the degree to which they 

227
00:13:34,164 --> 00:13:39,300
say they're looking for sugar, they like 
sugary versus non-sugary cereals. 

228
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,600
And then what we did is we had them 
sample a range of different cereals and 

229
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,285
their report of those, of how much they 
like those cereals was quite different as 

230
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:51,420
a function of whether they really value 
sugary cereals or not. 

231
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,837
And specifically, the story is this, when 
people say they strongly value sugary 

232
00:13:54,837 --> 00:13:59,90
cereals, the more sugar content in the 
cereal, the more they like it. 

233
00:13:59,90 --> 00:14:01,508
If they say that they don't care that 
much about how much sugar is in cereal, 

234
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,820
then sugar content is irrelevant to how 
much they like the cereal. 

235
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,748
That is a totally self-evident silly 
point, but contrast the slide on the 

236
00:14:07,748 --> 00:14:10,820
lower right to the other three slides, 
and you can see that there's something 

237
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,944
about the mating domain. 
We seem not to have insight into what it 

238
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:19,10
is that we like in the mating domain. 
What will inspire our attraction? 

239
00:14:19,10 --> 00:14:22,159
Even though we a good sense of that in a 
simpler domain like cereal. 

240
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,288
These are college students at 
Northwestern, maybe upper social economic 

241
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:29,30
status on average. 
What about middle-aged people? 

242
00:14:29,30 --> 00:14:31,567
And what about people who aren't 
reporting on initial attraction, but 

243
00:14:31,567 --> 00:14:35,490
people who are actually involved in an 
established romantic relationship, right? 

244
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,416
Would you see the same sorts of patterns? 
Maybe, maybe our ideal preferences start, 

245
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,452
for a certain trait, start to be much 
more important once we're making marriage 

246
00:14:41,452 --> 00:14:45,705
decisions for example. 
So here, we're looking at the distinction 

247
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:48,414
between, at the correspondence between 
what you say is important to you and 

248
00:14:48,414 --> 00:14:51,540
what's actually important in a much older 
sample. 

249
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,552
Specifically, 500 participants and the 
average age of these participants was 41 

250
00:14:55,552 --> 00:14:58,236
years old. 
The procedure was simple, people 

251
00:14:58,236 --> 00:15:02,330
completed an online questionnaire, they 
were all romantically unattached. 

252
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,36
they were single at the time they 
reported on that they first started the 

253
00:15:05,36 --> 00:15:07,760
study, and they reported their mate 
preferences. 

254
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,595
So, on a scale from 1 to 9, how much do 
you value earning prospects, how much do 

255
00:15:10,595 --> 00:15:14,285
you value good looks, etcetera. 
And then, we let 2 and a half years pass 

256
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:17,164
and we followed up with the same 500 
people again. 

257
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:19,804
And they reported on either a current 
partner, if they were involved in a 

258
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:22,752
relationship at this point, which many of 
them were or they reported on a desired 

259
00:15:22,752 --> 00:15:25,744
partner, the person that they were most 
interested in, if they weren't currently 

260
00:15:25,744 --> 00:15:31,275
involved with somebody. 
And then we accessed romantic interest. 

261
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:34,741
So how romantically attracted are you? 
How satisfied are you with this person, 

262
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:36,980
etcetera? 
Marriage intentions, to what degree would 

263
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,687
you like to marry this person? 
And marital status, because some of our 

264
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:43,270
people who were single when the study 
started were now engaged or married. 

265
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,830
And it turns out as you can see in this 
graph, which I won't, I won't present all 

266
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,600
the graphs, but this is illustrative, 
illustrative. 

267
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,760
So on the dimension of warmth, how much 
do you care about warmth? 

268
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,973
Turns out that people who say they care a 
great deal about warmth are equally 

269
00:15:54,973 --> 00:15:58,186
inspired by how warm their current 
partner is than people who say they don't 

270
00:15:58,186 --> 00:16:02,480
care that much about warmth. 
And here again, you have two exactly 

271
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,235
parallel lines just like I kept showing 
you repeatedly. 

272
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:08,511
Now, I won't show you all 21 of the, of 
the graphs, but they all basically look 

273
00:16:08,511 --> 00:16:11,787
like this and not one of them showed 
different lines as a function of whether 

274
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:15,219
you strongly cared about the trade in 
question versus said you didn't care that 

275
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:21,490
much about the, the trade in question. 
So, let's revisit the two questions, are 

276
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:25,900
there in fact these sex differences that 
we all believe to be true? 

277
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,682
Is it true that men prefer physical 
attractiveness in a partner more then 

278
00:16:29,682 --> 00:16:34,970
women do, that women prefer earning 
prospects in man more then men do? 

279
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:38,444
No, that is, yes, we have these theories 
that we care about those things. 

280
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:41,889
Those theories that we care about those 
things influence how we behave when it 

281
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:46,325
comes to online dating or personal ads. 
But once we have met somebody in the 

282
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:49,955
flesh and blood, there is no longer any 
sex difference in the degree to which and 

283
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:54,919
women care about earning prospects and 
physical attractiveness. 

284
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:59,780
Now, the second question is, do we really 
know what our romantic preferences are? 

285
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:03,66
That is, can we introspect, do we have 
self-insight and know what it is that 

286
00:17:03,66 --> 00:17:07,584
really makes us attracted to people? 
And here, again, there appears to be no 

287
00:17:07,584 --> 00:17:10,653
evidence that we do. 
across study after study after study and 

288
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:13,802
analysis after analysis after analysis, 
when we look at people who said, I care a 

289
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:17,92
great deal about this characteristic, and 
compared them to people who said, I don't 

290
00:17:17,92 --> 00:17:21,263
really care that much about that 
characteristic. 

291
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:24,318
They were in fact equally inspired, 
equally attracted to people as a function 

292
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,608
of how much they had the characteristic 
in question, like physical attractiveness 

293
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:32,350
or warmth for example. 
And finally, I want to call, I want to 

294
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,310
come back to the way dating works in the 
modern era and ask, is it really sensible 

295
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,490
for us to decide or learn who is 
compatible with us on the basis of 

296
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,130
browsing people's profiles? 
And I want to suggest to you that the 

297
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,826
answer is, no, that browsing profiles or 
20 seconds versus 20 minutes versus 20 

298
00:17:48,826 --> 00:17:52,522
hours is not going to give you different 
insight into who's compatible with you 

299
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:56,106
and online dating is a very useful tool 
as a way to broaden the amount of people 

300
00:17:56,106 --> 00:18:01,706
in your dating pool. 
But before you start ruling people out on 

301
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:04,698
the basis of their profile, remember, you 
might not know your preferences as much 

302
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:07,426
as you thought you did and you might be 
spending a whole lot of time browsing 

303
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:12,100
profiles that actually won't be 
informative to your mating life. 

304
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:17,950
What I encourage you to do is, sure, use 
online dating, use speed dating, and so 

305
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:24,800
forth, but get offline quickly for a 
quick chemistry check. 

306
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:31,513
That's the way you're going to learn 
whether there's romantic chemistry here.
