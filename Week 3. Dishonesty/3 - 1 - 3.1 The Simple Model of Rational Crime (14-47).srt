1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:08,982
The topic of this section is dishonesty,
the ways we lie and cheat but still think

2
00:00:08,982 --> 00:00:13,900
of our self as good people.
A guy goes into a church and goes into

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:19,574
confession, and he says to the priest,
forgive me Father for I have sinned.

4
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:22,587
And the father said, what have you done my
son?

5
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:28,577
And the guy said, I'm 72 years old and I
just had sex with two 25 year old twins.

6
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:33,908
And the priest said, this is terrible.
Please say 700 times Hail Mary and walk

7
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:38,728
around the church seven times, and give a
$1,000 to charity.

8
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:42,687
And how long has it been since your last
confession?

9
00:00:42,688 --> 00:00:46,428
I said, I've never been to confession.
And the priest said, you're 72 years old

10
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,857
and you've never been to confession?
How can that be?

11
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:54,708
The guy says, I'm Jewish.
So then, the priest said, so what are you

12
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:59,500
doing here and why you telling me?
And the guy said, I'm telling everybody.

13
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:05,232
What is it about dishonesty?
When we think about dishonesty, we have a

14
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,728
very simple model of dishonesty.
We have a model that people do the cost

15
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:10,860
benefit analysis.
What do we tend to gain?

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,757
What do we tend to lose?
Is this worth it?

17
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:17,800
But it turns out that throughout the
studies you will see in this section, this

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,612
is not actually a good model.
Instead, lots of other things are driving

19
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:27,861
us to both, be honest and be dishonest.
And as you will see, in more nuance and

20
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:32,689
complete understanding of this problem is
both going to help us figure out what's

21
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,146
going on.
And also help us figure out how to fight

22
00:01:36,146 --> 00:01:56,304
dishonesty.
So, first of all, try to be honest and ask

23
00:01:56,304 --> 00:02:13,855
yourself whether you have cheated in the
last year.

24
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:19,317
If you have, raise your hand.
What about the last month?

25
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,471
What about the last week?
What about today?

26
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:28,310
The reality's, as you probably realized,
that we lie and cheat lots of the time.

27
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,526
And at the same time, while we do those
actions, we don't think of our self as

28
00:02:32,526 --> 00:02:36,286
being immoral.
And that's kind of the dilemma I want to

29
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:39,440
talk about.
We often think about, crime, as a few

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,315
individuals who steal a lot of money and
cheat a lot, but I want us to think about

31
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:49,190
the cheating that we can all do, that we
can all be part of, and how does it really

32
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:53,117
work.
Okay, so I actually started thinking about

33
00:02:53,118 --> 00:02:57,717
dishonesty when Enron kind of collapsed
all of a sudden.

34
00:02:57,718 --> 00:03:02,698
And my question, the question that puzzled
me at the time was, what was the cause for

35
00:03:02,698 --> 00:03:07,442
the collapse of Enron?
Were there three bad apples that planned

36
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:11,250
and plotted and executed this incredible
accounting scheme?

37
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,320
Is this the best explanation for what's
going on?

38
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,934
Or, is the explanation to a lots of people
at Enron and around Enron that were not

39
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:25,884
active vicious people, but were turning a
blind eye to something really bad that was

40
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:31,217
going on and benefiting them at the same
time, kind of wishful blindness?

41
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:36,389
And I happened to meet John Perry Barlow,
who used to write lyrics and manage a

42
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,890
group called the, Grateful Dead.
And at some point John Perry Barlow, who's

43
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:45,516
a wonderful person, became a consultant
for Enron.

44
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:49,802
And this, of course, could be thought of
as a commentary of the times.

45
00:03:49,802 --> 00:03:54,464
But beyond that, when I met John Perry
Barlow, he told me that when he was a

46
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:59,348
consultant for Enron, not only was he
oblivious to what was going on, he created

47
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:03,788
an ideology for, from himself that
protected him from seeing all the bad

48
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:08,350
things that were happening around.
So, this was not just wish for blindness,

49
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,077
this was active blindness.
When he was trying to create an ideology

50
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:16,633
to make himself not see all the bad things
that he didn't want to see, because he was

51
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,798
getting paid.
So, this question of how do we want to

52
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,017
think about dishonesty.
Do we want to think about it as the

53
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:27,372
property of a few bad apples, or do we
want to think about it, about something

54
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:30,833
that we can all do, is actually very
important?

55
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:35,667
Because, for example, what should we do
about dishonesty as a company?

56
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:40,027
If we think it's only bad apples, then we
should improve our HR processes, we should

57
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:43,917
just not hire bad apples.
Or, if people become bad apples, we should

58
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:47,296
fire them later on.
But if everybody's capable of that, that's

59
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:49,605
not very easy.
The same thing we can ask about

60
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,518
governemnt.
What should the government do with bad

61
00:04:52,518 --> 00:04:54,956
apples?
If it's just a few of them, we can think

62
00:04:54,956 --> 00:04:58,895
about how to kick them off.
But there's something about the fabric of

63
00:04:58,895 --> 00:05:03,210
how the government governs and how people
are influenced by each other.

64
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:06,180
Then, we need to think very differently
about these structures.

65
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,097
And, of course, the same thing happens
with individuals cheating.

66
00:05:09,097 --> 00:05:16,375
So, let's take a step back and let's say,
what do we know about cheating and how do

67
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:19,289
we measure it?
So, let's start with the measurement

68
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,311
issue.
I do experiments, I try to create

69
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:25,406
something that I can measure a bit more
precisely than asking people for their

70
00:05:25,406 --> 00:05:27,930
opinions about something or what they
would do.

71
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,046
And here is the method I came up with.
We gave people a sheet of paper with 20

72
00:05:33,046 --> 00:05:36,712
simple math problems.
These were math problems that everybody

73
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,294
could solve given enough time.
You would just have to look for the

74
00:05:40,294 --> 00:05:44,477
different cells in the matrix and look for
the two numbers that add to ten.

75
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,093
There's lots of those combinations.
And when you find the one that, the two

76
00:05:48,093 --> 00:05:50,850
numbers that add to ten, you know that
you've found it.

77
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,746
But, it takes a while to find this.
So, we give people a sheet of these

78
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:59,050
problems, we give them 20 problems in one
sheet.

79
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:03,259
And we say, why don't you go ahead and
solve as many of those as you can in the

80
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:07,744
next five minutes and we will pay you,
let's say, a dollar per question for each

81
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:11,726
one you get correct.
We say to people, please flip the page and

82
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:15,689
get go, start, and people start.
They work as fast as they can.

83
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,402
And the end of the five minutes we say,
stop, put your pencil down and count how

84
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:24,771
many questions you got correctly.
Again, these are questions that are quite

85
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:27,410
self-evident whether you got the right or
not.

86
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,402
People count how many ones they got
correctly and then we say, now please take

87
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:37,316
the sheet of paper and go to the back of
the room, and please shred the sheet of

88
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,502
paper.
And then, come back to the front of the

89
00:06:39,502 --> 00:06:42,570
room and tell me how many questions you
got correctly, and I will pay you

90
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,531
accordingly.
People do this, they count, they shred,

91
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:49,953
the come back to the front of the room,
and they announce how many questions they

92
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:54,080
got correctly.
People on average announced that they

93
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,480
solved six problems and they get paid
accordingly.

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,840
What the people in this experiment do not
know is that we fixed the shredder so the

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,758
shredder only shreds the sides of the
page.

96
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:09,046
So, when you put the page in, it gives you
the satisfaction of the noise of the

97
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:13,194
shredder and the slowness of the
progression but the main part of the page

98
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:16,132
remains intact.
And we can jump in later on and find out

99
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,777
how many problems people really solve
correctly.

100
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:23,146
And what do we find when we do it?
We find that people solve 4 problems, but

101
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:27,108
they report to be solving 6.
Now you can ask the question of, how is

102
00:07:27,108 --> 00:07:31,755
this distribution of cheating looks like?
Is it most people are honest, reporting

103
00:07:31,755 --> 00:07:34,828
four and solving really four?
And a few people are cheating a lot, and

104
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:38,702
they are shifting the average?
No, it turns out that lots and lots of

105
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:42,140
people cheat.
In fact, we find very few people that

106
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,132
cheat in a egregious way, and instead we
find lots and lots of people who cheat

107
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:50,222
just a little.
Now, you can say, okay.

108
00:07:50,222 --> 00:07:55,036
So, let's find out why are people and why
are people cheating a little bit.

109
00:07:55,036 --> 00:08:00,204
So, to examine this, let's first think
about what is the economic rational theory

110
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:03,066
of cheating.
An economic rational theory of cheating

111
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,880
goes back to the famous Chicago economist,
Gary Becker.

112
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,096
And the story goes that Gary Becker is one
day driving to the University of Chicago

113
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:14,412
looking for a place to park his car.
He can't find a legal parking spot and

114
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:18,680
he's about to be late for a meeting.
And Gary Becker does a quick calculation.

115
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,740
He said, what is the benefit of getting to
the meeting on time?

116
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:28,250
What is the cost of parking illegally?
And he makes, he compares those things.

117
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,539
Decide to park illegally and gets to the
meeting on time.

118
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,205
And as he walks around the University of
Chicago to the meeting, he thinks that

119
00:08:36,205 --> 00:08:40,091
what he has done is basically a
cost/benefit analysis about a crime, a

120
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:43,480
minor crime, but a crime.
He was thinking about the benefit of

121
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,512
getting to the meeting on time, he was
thinking about the risk of being caught

122
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:51,733
and getting a ticket and the cost of such
parking ticket, and he was comparing the

123
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,775
two of them.
And in comparing the benefit and the cost,

124
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:58,525
he decided, well, it's worthwhile for him
to park illegally, or not.

125
00:08:58,526 --> 00:09:03,630
And from that point on, Gary Becker said
that all decisions about moral issues and

126
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,227
dishonesty are like that.
They're about the cost and benefits.

127
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:12,252
So, for example, every time you pass by a
grocery store or a gas station, you should

128
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,884
ask yourself, how much money is in the
till?

129
00:09:14,885 --> 00:09:18,970
What's the chance of catch me if I rob
this grocery store and gas station?

130
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,930
How much time will I get in prison minus
the time for good behavior?

131
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,166
And you should do a cost benefit analysis
and decide whether to hit the gas station

132
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,069
or not.
Realize that in this conception of this

133
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,103
problem, there's no morality.
It's just about cost and benefit.

134
00:09:35,104 --> 00:09:40,078
So, that's with this understanding about
constant benefit and the rational approach

135
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:43,397
for dishonesty.
Let's take a step back and let's go back

136
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:48,215
to the method, the little experiment with
the matrices, and see, can we test the

137
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:50,924
Becker theory?
So, the Becker theory has three

138
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,324
components.
How much money you intend to gain?

139
00:09:53,325 --> 00:09:56,806
What's the probability you will get
caught, and how much time will you get in

140
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,870
prison?
What's the side of the punishment?

141
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:02,530
We started with the first one, how much
money do you stand to gain?

142
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:06,670
We gave this sheet to some people and we
said, if you solve these problems

143
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,953
correctly, for each on you solve, you will
get 10 cents.

144
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:13,132
To another group you said, for each
problem you will solve, you will get 25

145
00:10:13,132 --> 00:10:17,314
cents.
Another group we offered 50 cents, another

146
00:10:17,314 --> 00:10:20,826
$1, $2, $5.
The highest group was promised $10 per

147
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:23,926
correct question.
We gave them, we gave them five minutes,

148
00:10:23,926 --> 00:10:26,877
they did the task, they shredded the piece
of paper, they reported.

149
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:31,108
How much cheating did we see?
And what happened to cheating as a

150
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:36,060
function of how much money they were
promised per correct question?

151
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,714
Before I go to the answer for this, we
created another experiment in which we

152
00:10:39,714 --> 00:10:42,710
just describe to people in the same way
I'm describing to you.

153
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:46,225
We describe to people the experiment.
And we say, hey, if this was the

154
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:51,189
experiment, how much do you think people
would cheat at 25 cents, 50 cents, $1, $2,

155
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:55,003
$5, $10?
And what people predicted, what they

156
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:59,287
thought would happen was that cheating
would increase as the amount of the reward

157
00:10:59,287 --> 00:11:01,864
goes up.
In essence, people had the same theory as

158
00:11:01,864 --> 00:11:05,726
Becker, that cheating is influenced by the
amount of money we stand to gain.

159
00:11:05,726 --> 00:11:09,600
And therefore, as the amount of money goes
up, so will the level of cheating.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,479
But when we did the experiment for real,
what did we find?

161
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,020
We find lots of people cheating just by a
little bit.

162
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,268
And this amount of cheating was
independent on the amount of money that

163
00:11:21,268 --> 00:11:24,696
they got.
In fact, for $10 per correct question,

164
00:11:24,696 --> 00:11:28,870
cheating was slightly lower than for all
other amounts.

165
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,975
So, first of all, it doesn't go up.
And if anything, it goes down.

166
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:36,307
That was the first part of the Becker
element.

167
00:11:36,308 --> 00:11:38,840
What about the next one?
What about the probability of being

168
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,549
caught?
We played with that as well.

169
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:45,352
Some people, we asked them to tear half
the sheet and only shred half the sheet

170
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:50,077
and submit to us the other half so we
would have some evidence of what they did

171
00:11:50,077 --> 00:11:54,458
and some evidence were eliminated.
Other people we asked to eliminate and

172
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:58,442
shred the whole sheet of paper.
Another group we asked to shred the piece

173
00:11:58,442 --> 00:12:02,522
of paper, leave the room, and pay
themselves from a bowl of money that had

174
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,487
over $100 in it.
Now, if you think about it, shredding half

175
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:09,957
the page has some probability of being
caught.

176
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,490
Shredding the whole page has less
probability of being caught.

177
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,974
Shredding the whole page and leaving and
paying yourself with a bowl of money had

178
00:12:15,974 --> 00:12:19,068
even lower probability of being caught.
What happened?

179
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:23,350
Again, before I tell you the real result,
we ask people to predict.

180
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,705
What do you think would happen?
And people predicted, as the probability

181
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,920
of being caught will go down, the amount
of cheating will go up.

182
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,543
Again, suggesting that peoples' naive
theories about driving, what's driving

183
00:12:35,543 --> 00:12:39,167
this dishonesty, is very much in line with
the Becker theory.

184
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,420
But what did we find when we did the
experiments for real?

185
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:46,070
We found that lots of people cheated just
by a little bit independent of the

186
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,020
probability of being caught.
Now, you might say something else.

187
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:55,180
You might say, you know, maybe what's
going on here is the people think they can

188
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,342
cheat a little bit and not being caught.
If you say, oh, you know, if I really saw

189
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:02,120
four and I only report six, nobody will be
suspicious.

190
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,979
But if I report seven, all of a sudden
people would become suspicious of that.

191
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,980
So, we tried that as well.
We told some people, we say, hey, the

192
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,127
average person in this experiment solves
four problems.

193
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,788
We told another group that the average
person in the experiment solves eight

194
00:13:17,788 --> 00:13:20,429
problems.
Now, if people just don't want to be

195
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:25,257
detected when they're told other people
have solved four, maybe they would claim

196
00:13:25,257 --> 00:13:27,440
six.
And when they were told other people would

197
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,819
solve eight, they could report ten.
But what happened?

198
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,180
No difference between those two
conditions.

199
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,810
In both of them, people really solved four
and reported six.

200
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:42,162
So again, it doesn't look like it's about
the probability of being caught or about

201
00:13:42,162 --> 00:13:45,763
wanting to go above some threshold, and
not even about the reward.

202
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:50,690
So, what is going on here?
You could say, well, people don't care

203
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:56,140
about the rewards and punishment.
How much they stand to gain, probability

204
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:59,736
of being caught.
People are just moral, wonderful,

205
00:13:59,736 --> 00:14:03,006
creatures.
Maybe in Freudian terms, it would be the

206
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,618
super ego.
We have this notion of society about what

207
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:08,904
is appropriate and inappropriate and we've
internalized that.

208
00:14:08,905 --> 00:14:11,190
And that's basically what's ruling our
behavior.

209
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,378
What kind of angels?
But, you know, we can't say that as well

210
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:16,540
because we see lots of people are
cheating.

211
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,268
Just a little bit but lots of people are
cheating.

212
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:23,560
So, we have this tension that people are
dishonest but at the same time people

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,800
don't react to their economic incentives.
So, what we need is a new model of what

214
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:37,144
causes people to be dishonest that is not
relying solely on economic incentive of

215
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:43,732
the amount of money to be gained,
probability of being caught, and time in

216
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:44,642
prison.
