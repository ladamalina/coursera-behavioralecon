1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:06,862
So what we thought, was that maybe what's
going on here, and there's a fudge factor,

2
00:00:06,862 --> 00:00:12,722
that people try to balance two forces.
On one hand, we want to look at the mirror

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:18,863
and feel that we're good honest wonderful
moral people, that's the psychological

4
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:24,977
benefit of viewing ourself positively.
On the other hand, we want to benefit from

5
00:00:24,977 --> 00:00:30,080
cheating, that's the economic incentive.
Now usually you would say, you can have

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,749
one or the other.
How can you both think of yourself as a

7
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:36,180
wonderful honest person, and benefit from
cheating at the same time?

8
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,772
It doesn't work.
Well, maybe, maybe due to our flexible

9
00:00:39,772 --> 00:00:45,148
cognitive ability, maybe due to the fact
that we can rationalize things very

10
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:50,776
quickly, as long as we cheat just a little
bit, we can both benefit from cheating,

11
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:55,610
just a little bit, and we can still view
ourself as honorable people.

12
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,018
And that's what we call the fudge factor.
That the moment we start creating a

13
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:04,698
dishonest behavior, there's a range before
it invokes a different concept of

14
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,746
ourselves.
And in that range, we could both be

15
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:11,617
dishonest, and still think of our self as
honest people.

16
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:17,550
So how do we test this kind of a theory?
The first thing we wanted to do, is we

17
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,080
wanted to take some approaches and shrink
the fudge factor.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,136
We want to get people to cheat less by,
but not by manipulating their economic

19
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:29,256
variables.
And the first idea for this came from a

20
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,824
little joke.
And the joke is that a guy goes to the

21
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:35,982
Rabbi and he said, Rabbi you wouldn't
believe what happened to me, somebody

22
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:39,656
stole my bicycle from Synagogue.
And the Rabbi is appalled, he say I can't

23
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:42,260
believe this is happening, this is awful,
this is terrible.

24
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,050
I tell you what you do, come to synagogue
next week and sit in the front row.

25
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,528
And as we go over the Ten Commandments,
turn around, and look at everybody in the

26
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,304
aisles.
And when we get to Thou Shalt Not Steal,

27
00:01:54,304 --> 00:01:57,992
see who can't look you in the eyes, you'll
know that's your thief.

28
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:01,067
The guy's very excited about the advice.
The rabbi is very excited about the

29
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,412
advice.
He comes to synagogue, sit in the front

30
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:05,915
row, turns around during the Ten
Commandments.

31
00:02:05,915 --> 00:02:08,408
He comes to the Rabbi at the end of the
service.

32
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:13,745
He says, "Rabbi, you wouldn't believe it.
What a fantastic idea, it worked just like

33
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:17,927
a charm.
The moment, the moment we got to "Thou

34
00:02:17,927 --> 00:02:23,957
shall not commit adultery" I remembered
where I left my bike.

35
00:02:23,957 --> 00:02:27,240
Now where, [laugh] where is this joke
leading us?

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,310
You probably think to yourself where is
the experiment in this thing?

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,918
Well, we went to UCLA, and we asked about
500 students to try and recall the ten

38
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:38,576
commandments.
Interestingly by the way, none of them

39
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:42,074
could recall all ten commandments and
quite a few of them invented new ones, but

40
00:02:42,074 --> 00:02:47,924
that's a topic for a different discussion.
But after getting them to try and recall

41
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:51,376
the ten commandments we gave them the same
math task.

42
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:55,938
And we were wondering how much would they
cheat after just thinking about the ten

43
00:02:55,938 --> 00:02:57,489
commandments.
What did we see?

44
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:01,438
Zero cheating.
Now it wasn't as if the people remembered

45
00:03:01,438 --> 00:03:05,425
moral commandments.
Presuming the more religious people

46
00:03:05,425 --> 00:03:09,110
cheated less, and the people who could
hardly remember any commandment cheated

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,938
more?
No, nobody cheated.

48
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:16,774
In fact even when we take self-declared
atheist, and we asked them to swear on the

49
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:21,382
Bible, and then we give them a chance to
steal from us in the same way in the same

50
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:26,850
task, we see no cheating whatsoever.
So this suggests that it's not about

51
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:30,945
cost-benefit, it's not about people
thinking about heaven or hell and this is

52
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:35,136
why they should be honest or not.
It's about reminding people about their

53
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:39,759
own morality, because even if you remind
people about morality that is not their

54
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,662
own, like atheists are being reminded
about the Ten Commandments.

55
00:03:43,662 --> 00:03:48,422
Being, thinking, just thinking about
morality, shrinks our fudge factor, get us

56
00:03:48,422 --> 00:03:52,902
to be a bit more careful about our own
behavior and therefore allowing us to be

57
00:03:52,902 --> 00:03:56,665
more, more honest.
Now, eh, this was kind of an interesting

58
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:59,700
idea.
But you know religion and civic society

59
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:05,220
and there's all kinds of issues whether we
want to involve religion in many, in many

60
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,180
places, so the next thing we decided to do
was to try a secular version of it.

61
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,230
And at the university it's very natural to
use the honor code.

62
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:16,560
So we did this model at MIT and at Yale.
We went to the students.

63
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,860
And we edit one sentence to the beginning
of the test.

64
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,496
I understand that this short survey falls
under the MIT or Yale honor code

65
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:27,476
signature.
What happened?

66
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:32,357
People signed, they did the test, they
shredded, no cheating whatsoever.

67
00:04:32,358 --> 00:04:37,188
And no cheating whatsoever despite the
fact that neither MIT nor Yale actually

68
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:40,780
have an honor code.
Now this means that those two universities

69
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,064
don't have specific costs associated with
cheating.

70
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:49,851
But nevertheless, being reminded about
some moral element decreased cheating so

71
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:54,075
dramatically we couldn't detect any.
Now in contrast, we went to another

72
00:04:54,075 --> 00:04:56,220
university that has a very strong honor
code.

73
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,150
We went to Princeton.
Princeton has a very strong honor code.

74
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,463
They take the freshmen and they give them
a, a week long, a lesson on honesty.

75
00:05:05,463 --> 00:05:09,694
There's lectures and discussion, the a
capella group has a song about it, it's,

76
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:12,102
the whole week is a crash course on
morality.

77
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:16,400
We waited two weeks, after these freshmen
finished with their crash course on

78
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,822
morality, and we tempted them to cheat in
the same way, some of them with signing,

79
00:05:20,822 --> 00:05:24,361
some of them without signing.
What do you think happened?

80
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,840
Would the Princeton student be different
than the Yale, and MIT student?

81
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,550
They were not.
When they did not sign the code, they

82
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,180
cheated just like the MIT and Yale
student.

83
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,982
When they signed, they didn't cheat just
like the MIT and Yale students.

84
00:05:37,982 --> 00:05:42,228
So this is kind of a good news, bad news.
The bad news, is that a week-long crash

85
00:05:42,228 --> 00:05:47,940
course on morality doesn't seem to have
any measurable effects two weeks down the

86
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:51,320
road, at least not the Princeton version
of it.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:57,638
And I think the same thing applies to many
corporate lessons and, university, classes

88
00:05:57,638 --> 00:06:01,680
and so on, in morality.
Morality training just doesn't seem to be

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,052
that effective, that's the bad news.
The good news, is that reminding people

90
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:10,532
about their own morality, whether it has
consequences or not when, like Princeton,

91
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:15,012
it has really huge penalty if you're being
caught cheating versus MIT and Yale, that

92
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:18,252
you don't, that seemed to actually make a
big difference.

93
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:22,352
So rather than thinking about global
cultural changes, that might be very nice

94
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:25,884
but very hard to achieve.
Maybe what we need to focus on, is to

95
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:31,060
think about how we change things just
before people are tempted to be dishonest.

96
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,941
In the next version of this we tried one
more thing, we tried some people signed

97
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:40,257
first, before they did the test, and some
people signed afterward.

98
00:06:40,258 --> 00:06:43,440
What did we find?
If you signed first, people don't cheat.

99
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,235
If you sign at the end, people cheat just
a lot, because it's finished, you finished

100
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:50,127
cheating.
And so with this idea we went to the IRS

101
00:06:50,127 --> 00:06:53,407
and we said to the IRS think about all the
IRS forms.

102
00:06:53,408 --> 00:06:56,456
Right.
People finish the IRS form and then at the

103
00:06:56,456 --> 00:07:00,898
end, many pages later you sign.
At that point your signature is not doing

104
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:05,228
anything to prime morality.
And nobody's going to say, oh, yes, let me

105
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:09,150
sign, let me go back and fix things.
No, cheating is over by that time.

106
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,882
The form is being finished.
So we said to the IRS, why don't you put

107
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:16,040
the signature up front?
Why don't you start by signing?

108
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,804
Eh, well the people at the IRS said this
is illegal, because signature is meant for

109
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:25,500
verification, not for priming morality.
And you can actually see how signature has

110
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,217
these two very different functions, if
it's in the front or in the back.

111
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:33,300
So we said okay, we understand this.
Why don't you put both the signature in

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,814
the front and the signature in the back?
Well, they said, the people at the IRS

113
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:41,872
said, well, that's confusing.
I don't know if you've seen the IRS forms

114
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:46,142
recently, or the IRS tax a code, but you
know the idea that signing twice is

115
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:49,788
confusing, baffled me a little bit.
I was speechless.

116
00:07:49,788 --> 00:07:54,508
But then I said okay, if that's confusing
how about if the first item on the tax

117
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:59,814
return, would ask people would you give
$25 to a task force to fight corruption.

118
00:07:59,815 --> 00:08:04,030
And we said this is not just a signature,
this is asking people whether they want to

119
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,476
put money towards something.
And if people commit, and commit money

120
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:11,823
towards something, there's a good chance
that later on, they will continue acting

121
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:14,367
in a more, eh, appropriate, honest,
behavior.

122
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:18,088
Plus, we said, the people that don't want
to give money a task force to fight

123
00:08:18,088 --> 00:08:21,231
corruption, maybe you can audit them, to a
higher degree.

124
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,530
Anyway, the IRS did not want to talk to us
anymore.

125
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,302
But we went to talk to an insurance
company.

126
00:08:26,302 --> 00:08:30,446
Interesting, this was insurance company
that insures, eh, homes and houses, lots

127
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:33,379
of personal things.
And they told us, that they think that

128
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:37,181
their cheating, that they are seeing, is
very much like in our experiments.

129
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:42,434
They think that very few people invent
burglaries, and arsenies, and larceny, and

130
00:08:42,434 --> 00:08:47,070
car theft, but lots and lots and lots of
people, when something bad happen

131
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,548
exaggerated by 10, 15%.
And they estimated that these exaggeration

132
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:56,180
cost industry about $24 billion, a year
which is lots and lots of money.

133
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,393
I know we through lots of big numbers
these days, but 24 billion is still a big

134
00:08:59,393 --> 00:09:03,927
number.
So we came up with all kinds of ideas.

135
00:09:03,928 --> 00:09:08,764
We said, what if when people were waiting
on hold, you would play religious music

136
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,518
for them?
What would happen if you would put images

137
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:14,120
of eyes, as if they're being watched, on
the form?

138
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,644
What if you got them to sign first?
What if you got some declaration that had

139
00:09:18,644 --> 00:09:22,925
to do something with religion as well?
We had all kind of ideas about how you

140
00:09:22,925 --> 00:09:26,630
increase, em, honesty.
But you know, we had lots of good ideals

141
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,229
and they had lawyers and when you have
good ideas and lawyers together in the

142
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:35,610
same room nothing ever happen.
So after six months of trying very hard to

143
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,760
get this, nothing was done.
But my contact in this insurance company

144
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,086
felt very bad for me.
So he came to me and he gave me this form,

145
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:48,370
where you mail it to people and you ask
them to report how many miles you drove

146
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,932
last year.
Now imagine you got one of those form,

147
00:09:50,932 --> 00:09:53,588
what would you want to shade the number,
up or down?

148
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:57,116
If you shade it up, it would mean your
premium would go up, if you shade it down

149
00:09:57,116 --> 00:10:00,709
your premium will go down, so you'll
probably want to shade it down.

150
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,512
They gave us 20,000 forms and we did one
thing, we moved the signature line to the

151
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:08,640
top.
Half the people got the signature on the

152
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,221
top first and half the people got it at
the bottom.

153
00:10:12,221 --> 00:10:15,800
Some people signed first, and then filled
the mileage, some people fill the mileage

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,660
then sign.
What did we see?

155
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,060
There was a difference of about 2400 miles
on average.

156
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,040
The people who signed first reported
driving 2400 miles more.

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,584
Now we don't know if they didn't cheat at
all, but we know the cheating was much

158
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,465
reduced.
And that actually gives me great hope that

159
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:38,689
we can create those small interventions
and get them to work not just in the lab,

160
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:42,222
but get them in the field in all kinds of
other versions like that.

161
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,138
Okay, so all that was about how we shrink
the fudge factor.

162
00:10:46,138 --> 00:10:50,761
How do we get people to, at the moment,
tolerate less of their own immortality and

163
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:56,452
be more careful about what they're doing?
The next question we wanted to ask, was

164
00:10:56,452 --> 00:11:00,047
how do you get people to cheat more, how
do you expand the fudge factor?

165
00:11:00,047 --> 00:11:04,118
And of course, this is not an objective to
increase cheating in society, but for the

166
00:11:04,118 --> 00:11:08,189
purpose of understanding it, what kind of
things would get people to cheat more and

167
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:10,707
nevertheless feel comfortable with
themselves.

168
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,580
And the idea here also came from a little
joke.

169
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,935
And the little joke is, that little Johnny
comes home from school with a note from

170
00:11:16,935 --> 00:11:20,965
the teacher that says that little Johnny
stole a pencil from the kid who was

171
00:11:20,965 --> 00:11:24,103
sitting next to him.
And Johnny's father is furious and he

172
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:27,260
said, Johnny I'm humiliated and
embarrassed and I'm angry.

173
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:31,080
And you're grounded for three weeks and
just wait until your mother comes.

174
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:34,849
You never, never, never steal a pencil
from the kid who is sitting next to you.

175
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,000
And beside Johnny if you need something,
if you need a pencil you know very well

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,591
you can just say something.
You can just ask and I will bring you

177
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:48,310
dozens of pencils from work.
If you find this funny it's probably

178
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,798
because you realize that taking a pencil
from work feels very differently than

179
00:11:52,798 --> 00:11:57,354
taking 10 cents from petty cash box, even
if you were going to use those 10 cents to

180
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:01,596
buy yourself a pencil.
Perhaps the moment something becomes

181
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:05,958
multiple steps removed from money, there
are more stories we can tell ourselves.

182
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,885
Right, you could say the workplace wants
us to have these pencils, otherwise they

183
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:11,724
wouldn't put them there.
Or you could say other people take them,

184
00:12:11,724 --> 00:12:13,920
as well.
Or you could say, even if I take them and

185
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,440
give them to my kids, they will leave me
alone and that would allow me to answer

186
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,230
two more emails.
Good for the workplace.

187
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:25,351
And all of those distance allow us to tell
ourselves stories, allow us to rationalize

188
00:12:25,351 --> 00:12:30,319
things that basically create this ability
to cheat more, but nevertheless to feel

189
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:34,738
better about ourselves.
So the first experiment we did on this, is

190
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:40,349
I walked around campus and I put six packs
of Cokes, in some common refrigerators.

191
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,492
Now these were refrigerators that
everybody had their own stuff, but

192
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:46,200
multiple people had their stuff in the
same refrigerator.

193
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,560
And I basically wanted to see what is the
half lifetime of Coke.

194
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,130
How long will it take for my Cokes to
disappear?

195
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:58,489
And basically within 72 hours no Cokes
were left there, everything was gone.

196
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,770
Now in contrast, I took a plate with six
$1 bills, I put in the same refrigerators

197
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:06,785
and I waited.
And now what happened, nobody touched a

198
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,864
single dollar.
Now the students could have taken a

199
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:15,032
dollar, putting it in the nearby vending
machine, get coke and change, but nobody

200
00:13:15,032 --> 00:13:17,412
did.
When something is directly about money, we

201
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:22,168
feel very differently about it.
When something is removed from money, more

202
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:27,160
abstract, there are some stories we can
tell ourselves, rationalizing and,

203
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,650
therefore, we can be more dishonest.
Now this is not an ideal experiment,

204
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,790
because it's often the case that you open
the refrigerator and you find Coke.

205
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,255
It's not so common that you open the
refrigerator and find a plate with six $1

206
00:13:39,255 --> 00:13:41,590
bills, so something must have been very
strange.

207
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,920
So we did the same experiment, the same
principle with the same matrix test and

208
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,530
here's the experiment.
Some people got the sheet, solved it, came

209
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,822
to the experimenter, looked him in the
eyes and said, Mister experimenter I

210
00:13:56,822 --> 00:14:01,039
solved x problems, give me x dollars.
So they looked him in the eyes and they

211
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,892
cheated for dollars.
The second group did the same thing, but

212
00:14:04,892 --> 00:14:09,244
when they came to the experiment, the guy
looked him in the eyes, and they said, "Mr

213
00:14:09,244 --> 00:14:12,106
Experimenter, I solved x problems; give me
x tokens.

214
00:14:12,106 --> 00:14:16,201
So they were lying not for money, they
were lying for something that is tokens.

215
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:19,916
And we gave them tokens.
They took 12 feet to the side; they walked

216
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:23,980
12 feet to the side, and they replaced
these tokens for money.

217
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,877
Now they were lying for a pencil, but it
was a pencil for only a few seconds.

218
00:14:28,878 --> 00:14:32,902
It was one step removed from money, but
for a very, very short duration.

219
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:35,920
What happened?
Our participant doubled their cheating in

220
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,390
that condition.
And by the way this is for me one of the

221
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,846
most worrisome experiments we've ever
done.

222
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:45,746
Because if you think about it, we're
moving to becoming a cashless society, as

223
00:14:45,746 --> 00:14:49,084
consumers there's all these discussions
about digital wallets.

224
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:53,415
On Wall Street there's of course all these
complex financial tools that are becoming

225
00:14:53,415 --> 00:14:57,390
more steps removed from money.
People own more and more things like stock

226
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,640
options and things that are removed from
money.

227
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,910
And if being close to money and observing
it directly is what's keeping us

228
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:08,670
relatively honest, is it the case that in
all kinds of domains of life, electronic

229
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:13,500
wallets, financial markets, the more this
distance is increasing, the more we can

230
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,910
allow ourselves to both be dishonest and
think of our self as hon-, as honest

231
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:21,198
people.
And that really, really worries me.

232
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,357
So that was the first thing that got
people to cheat more, distance from money.

233
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:30,594
The next thing we wondered, is we wondered
what happened when you watched other

234
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:34,938
people cheat in an egregious way?
After all we open the newspaper everyday

235
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:38,025
and we see all kinds of stories about big
cheaters.

236
00:15:38,025 --> 00:15:42,610
What is the affect of observing other
people in society does to our own

237
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,220
morality?
So we repeated this same experiment with

238
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,410
two changes.
The first one was that we prepaid people,

239
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:53,417
everybody got an envelope with all the
money as if they solved all the problems.

240
00:15:53,418 --> 00:15:57,212
And we asked them at the end, to pay us
back the money they didn't make and to

241
00:15:57,212 --> 00:16:01,140
take only the money they deserve.
That was the first change.

242
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,310
The second change was that we hired an
acting student.

243
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,888
That acting student sat in the front seat
in the, in the classroom.

244
00:16:08,888 --> 00:16:13,554
And 30 seconds into the experiment, he
raised his hand and said, excuse me, I

245
00:16:13,554 --> 00:16:18,090
solved everything, what do I do now?
Now imagine you were in that experiment.

246
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,402
You're solving, you're working very hard,
you're still on problem number one, and

247
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:24,587
all of a sudden you see somebody who
claimed that they've solved everything.

248
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:27,487
You know for sure, without cheating,
there's no other way.

249
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:30,180
And the experimenter said, "You've solved
everything?

250
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,776
You're free to go." And you see that
person taking the envelope with all the

251
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:38,052
money and leaving the room.
What would happen now to your own

252
00:16:38,052 --> 00:16:41,120
morality?
Lots and lots of moral people cheat.

253
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,700
Now there's two ways to interpret this
result.

254
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,220
One is to say this is about cost/benefit
analysis.

255
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:51,919
Before you saw that guy cheating in an
egregious way, you thought to yourself, I

256
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,060
don't know what's the cost of cheating
here.

257
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,540
Maybe they will catch me.
Maybe somebody would run after me.

258
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,892
But after you saw a demonstration of
somebody cheating in this egregious way

259
00:17:00,892 --> 00:17:04,900
and nobody going after them, you say
there's no cost here let me cheat.

260
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,661
The other possibility, is that it's not
about the cost benefit analysis, but its

261
00:17:09,661 --> 00:17:13,676
about what you call social proof.
Its about giving people a demonstration

262
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:17,924
that people like them, from their society,
from their community, students at the same

263
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,694
university are cheating in such
circumstance.

264
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:24,916
And maybe because of that it is okay to
cheat in those things, not from a moral

265
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:29,010
perspective, but from a social agreement
persepctive this is the behavior.

266
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,962
Here is someone who has done it and is not
even feeling sorry about that.

267
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:37,630
As an analogy you can think about what if
everybody around you is downin-,

268
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,590
downloading illegal content, at some
point, do you start saying, okay, this is

269
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,180
just, I guess what is okay to do.
To separate those two things, we tried

270
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,300
these two explanations, we tried two
things.

271
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,640
The first one, is that instead of the
student cheating, we asked him to just

272
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,050
raise his hand and said excuse me, but
with this set of instructions, can't I

273
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:00,857
just say I solved everything and take all
the money and go home?

274
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:04,359
And the instructor said you know what?
You can, it's up to you.

275
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,180
So now it was clear that from a cost
benefit analysis you can cheat and get

276
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:13,433
away with it, but there was no example of
somebody actually doing it.

277
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:18,144
What happened now when we did this?
Cheating did not go up it actually went

278
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:20,554
down.
We did another version of this and in the

279
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,956
other version we changed the outfit of
this acting student.

280
00:18:23,957 --> 00:18:27,820
We ran this experiment at Carnegie Mellon.
All the students were Carnegie Mellon.

281
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,760
The acting student was a Carnegie Mellon
student.

282
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,460
They were all from that group.
In the second experiment, we ran this, eh,

283
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,948
version, but we dressed the acting student
with University of Pittsburgh outfit.

284
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:44,440
Now, when they stood up and say, excuse
me, I solved everything, and walked home

285
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,064
with all the money, you would still know
that it's the same cost benefit analysis,

286
00:18:49,064 --> 00:18:53,348
that now in this experiment you're not
going to be punished, but there was no

287
00:18:53,348 --> 00:18:56,266
social proof.
It wasn't as if somebody from your social

288
00:18:56,266 --> 00:19:00,160
group, from your friends, from your
community is cheating this way, it's those

289
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,500
other people from this other university
that we don't like so much.

290
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,170
It's those people who are immoral.
What happened now?

291
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:10,703
Cheating did not go up, it went down.
And basically I think that two things

292
00:19:10,703 --> 00:19:13,416
happened.
The first one, was that people were

293
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:18,448
reminded about morality and honesty by
seeing an egregious act of misbehavior, a

294
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,471
little bit like the ten commandments
version.

295
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:25,634
But it wasn't their group, it was what we
called an out group, it was somebody else

296
00:19:25,634 --> 00:19:28,643
behaving this way.
And therefore they did not take it as a

297
00:19:28,643 --> 00:19:31,242
signal that it's okay for them to do this
as well.

298
00:19:31,243 --> 00:19:34,430
So, so far we found two things that make
people cheat more.

299
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:38,522
We found that the distance for money and
we found the social acceptance, kind of

300
00:19:38,522 --> 00:19:40,980
seeing other people behave in egregious
way.

301
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,524
But we also wanted to find out what are
personality traits, which are the people

302
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:50,100
that would cheat more?
Now you could speculate a lot of things.

303
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,935
You can say maybe the people who are more
egocentric or maybe the people who are

304
00:19:53,935 --> 00:19:56,410
more competitive, maybe the people hate
losing.

305
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,638
You can speculate on a lot of things, but
if you think about our theory.

306
00:20:00,638 --> 00:20:04,800
Our theory is that people want to view
themselves as honest people and also want

307
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,030
to benefit from cheating.
We want to have the cake and eat it too.

308
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,670
We want both of those things.
Who are the people that could do that?

309
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:14,669
And what we thought was that maybe those
are creative people.

310
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,347
Because if it's all about rationalization,
if this kind of cheating we discover is

311
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:23,190
all about being able to cheat and
rationalize it, so it doesn't affect our

312
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,540
own image, people who are more creative
presumably can just tell better stories.

313
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,921
They can cheat more and rationalize it to
an even higher degree, so we tried that.

314
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:37,224
We tried to measure people creativity and
measure how much they cheat, and we found

315
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:41,575
that more creative people cheat more.
We tried to increase creativity with some

316
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:45,220
creativity enhancing exercises.
And we found that as we were increase

317
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,419
creativity slightly, we also got cheating
to increase slightly.

318
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,079
We also went to a big advertising agency,
and we checked the moral flexibility of

319
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,190
people in different jobs in that
advertising agency.

320
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,100
And we saw that as the job required more
creativity, people cheated more.

321
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:04,812
There was less cheating in accounting,
accounting much more cheating in the

322
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:08,101
creative professions.
And, you know, maybe it is good that

323
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:13,000
there's less cheating in accounting, but
it clearly supports this theory that our

324
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,460
version of cheating, it's all about this
rationalizing.

325
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,220
It's about acting badly and rationalizing,
and the question is to what extent can we

326
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,803
do it.
If we're multiple distance, multiple steps

327
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:26,320
removed from money, we can do it to a
higher degree.

328
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,984
If people around us are doing it more, we
can do it to a higher degree.

329
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,923
If we ourselves are better storytellers,
more creative storytellers, we can do it

330
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:37,296
to a higher degree.
All of those things are contributing to a

331
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,704
very high degree.
So what have we learned up to this point?

332
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:45,376
I think if we think about the Becker
model, that cheating is basically driven

333
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:49,632
by how much to I stand gain?
What's the probability of being caught?

334
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:54,168
What kind of punishment will I get?
And doing some cost benefit analysis.

335
00:21:54,168 --> 00:22:00,344
That doesn't explain much of our behavior.
It's also not the case that we have bad

336
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,937
apples.
If you think about what is real cheating

337
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:05,329
due to?
In Enron, and other cases, is it due to

338
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:09,197
bad apples, or is it due to lots and lots
of people cheating a little bit?

339
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:13,089
I think it's much more due to lots and
lots of people, cheating a little bit.

340
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:17,567
And specifically we learned a few things
that either hinder it or increase it.

341
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:22,860
So we learned that getting people to think
more carefully about their morality

342
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,347
shrinks the fudge factor and gets people
to behave more honestly.

343
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:29,576
We also learned that it's all about
rationalization.

344
00:22:29,576 --> 00:22:33,939
So, when we have something that is
multiple steps removed from money, we can

345
00:22:33,939 --> 00:22:36,733
cheat more, and at the same time
rationalize it.

346
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:41,576
When you see other people around us
behaving in immoral ways, we can cheat a

347
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:45,765
bit more, and rationalizing it.
And when we ourselves are creative, we can

348
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:49,832
rationalize, we can tell better stories,
cheat more, and feel good about ourselves.

349
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:54,359
And I think that if we have this
perspective, it means we should not direct

350
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:57,651
much of our attention to the cost-benefit
analysis.

351
00:22:57,652 --> 00:23:02,925
We should not think about something like,
how do we expose people, and how do we

352
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,382
punish them, and how do we, eh,
surveillance them?

353
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:10,332
Because all of those approaches are driven
to this idea that people are just doing

354
00:23:10,332 --> 00:23:13,891
the cost-benefit analysis.
And if you say no, most of the cheating is

355
00:23:13,891 --> 00:23:18,000
not about that, it's about what people can
feel comfortable with themselves.

356
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,958
Now we have to ask with different
approaches, how do we get people to be

357
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:24,559
comfortable with less cheating?
How do we get people to become aware of

358
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,110
their own traps?
How do we create rules that don't allow

359
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:31,313
this flexibility in terms of
rationalization?

360
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:34,573
And I think this will be the actual
Improvement.

361
00:23:34,574 --> 00:23:39,341
You know, across all of our experiments,
we ran about 30,000 people, we found about

362
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:43,189
12 people that cheated a lot, and we lost
about $150 to these guys.

363
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:48,859
We found about 18,000 people who cheated
just a little bit, and we lost about

364
00:23:48,859 --> 00:23:52,444
$36,000 to those people.
And I think that this is probably a good

365
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:55,890
reflection of what's happening in society.
Sure, there are bad apples.

366
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,974
There are people who steal, and so on.
And it's terrible.

367
00:23:58,974 --> 00:24:03,549
But economically, it's a small potato,
these are small things in terms of

368
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:06,885
economic impact.
The big economic impact comes from lots of

369
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:11,043
people cheating a little bit, but because
there are so many of them the economic

370
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:14,514
impact is much higher.
And I don't think we need to stop thinking

371
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:18,804
about the crooks, but I think we need to
pay more attention to the people who can

372
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:21,982
change just a little bit and feel good
about themselves.

373
00:24:21,982 --> 00:24:31,483
Now, I think if we do it, everybody would
be better off.
