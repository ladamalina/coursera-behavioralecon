1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,950
Everything I told you up to now was about
one chance of cheating.

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,222
But of course, an imposing question is,
what happens when we give people more

3
00:00:12,222 --> 00:00:17,046
chances to cheat over time?
So we created a task like that.

4
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:20,349
We showed people some dots.
On the computer screen and we asked them

5
00:00:20,349 --> 00:00:23,217
are there more dots on the right or more
dots on the left.

6
00:00:23,218 --> 00:00:27,242
Tell us which one has more dots, but just
so you know, you're getting paid ten times

7
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:30,824
more if you say right.
And this came up to equivalent conflicts

8
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:33,990
of interest tasks.
When you ask a doctor for example, whats

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,690
better for this patient, treatment A or
treatment B?

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,499
But you, the doctor, gets ten times more
if you say.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,916
Let them go for treatment A.
So what happened with this task we could

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,430
do many, many, many of them, hundreds of
,them over time.

13
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,812
And what we saw was that many people
started by cheating just a little bit.

14
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:54,070
Cheating just a little bit.
Feeling good about myself, cheating a

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,924
little bit, feeling good.
But at some point, many people switched.

16
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:00,230
And all of a sudden, started cheating all
the time.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,451
And this switch happened to different
people at different times, but it was very

18
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:06,928
salient that there was this switch
occurred.

19
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:10,180
Our issue was where is this switching
coming from.

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,838
And one of the thoughts we had was that
maybe this is what we call the What the

21
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:16,046
Hell effect.
If you think about it, you've been trying

22
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:18,862
to feel good about yourself and cheat a
little bit, and at some point you cheat

23
00:01:18,862 --> 00:01:21,485
too much.
And you can't feel good about yourself any

24
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:23,776
more.
You might say, forget about it, let me

25
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:26,550
just enjoy it as much as I can, and cheat
all the way.

26
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:31,533
And that's indeed what we see in the data.
So if you had a little bit of cheating and

27
00:01:31,533 --> 00:01:34,007
then cheating a lot.
And by the way, a lot of people reported

28
00:01:34,007 --> 00:01:36,993
it happened to them in dieting.
When you start the day and you decide to

29
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:40,399
be good on your diet and then you eat the
muffin or you eat something bad you say

30
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:44,480
forget about it.
I'll star tomorrow, I'll start next, next

31
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,192
Monday.
So if we have this pattern, when people

32
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:50,705
cheat a little bit and then they switch to
cheating all the time.

33
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:53,920
We thought what ever stop people from
cheating all the time?

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,902
What would ever reset this fudge factor?
And, and we went back and we thought about

35
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:03,287
religion.
And if you think about the Catholic

36
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:07,238
confession, I'm of course not Catholic.
You can ask what is the logic of the

37
00:02:07,238 --> 00:02:10,521
Catholic confession?
Now if you actually came to the Catholic

38
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:14,828
confession from an economic perspective.
You would say that if you can sin and get

39
00:02:14,828 --> 00:02:18,200
absolved you should cheat more, because
you can get absolved.

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,610
In fact, you should sin on the way to
confession.

41
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,161
If you want to minimize time in purgatory,
the only thing you want is to cheat just

42
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:28,724
before you confess.
But of course this is not what the

43
00:02:28,724 --> 00:02:33,582
religion thinks, and we went to talk to
all kinds of Catholic priests about this.

44
00:02:33,582 --> 00:02:37,878
So if we don't think that confession
increases cheating, how could it reduce

45
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,192
cheating?
One theory is that confession adds to the

46
00:02:41,192 --> 00:02:45,010
cost of the crime.
You say to yourself like in the Baker

47
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,105
theory, not only do I have a chance of
being caught and go to prison, but I have

48
00:02:49,105 --> 00:02:53,265
to talk to somebody and they would make me
feel bad about it and let me, recite,

49
00:02:53,265 --> 00:02:57,547
something 1,500 times, that's not good.
Not worth it, let me not cheat.

50
00:02:57,547 --> 00:03:00,833
Not much evidence on there.
We thought maybe what happened is that

51
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:05,136
just like the Ten Commandment experiment,
that the moment you get out of confession.

52
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:08,800
You feel wonderful and pure, and you don't
want to disturb that feeling.

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,635
So for a little bit of time after that
you're behaving more consistent with the

54
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:16,721
tenets of the religion.
Or we thought maybe what's happening is

55
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,372
confession is a particularly useful idea
for resetting a new page.

56
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:23,295
If you cheat all the time, why would you
ever stop?

57
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:27,857
Unless you can start a new page and
therefore start again.

58
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:30,755
So we tried experiments like this.
People cheated a little bit, they start

59
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:34,270
cheating a lot then we stop them.
So here's a piece of paper.

60
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,707
Would you like to write something about
something bad you have done recently?

61
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,777
People wrote something and we asked them
to shred it.

62
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:44,999
Then we gave them another sheet and said,
would you like to ask for forgiveness from

63
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:48,990
whatever deity you believe in?
Please write it down, and shred it when

64
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,974
you're finished.
What happened after people did both of

65
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:54,319
those elements?
Saying what they have done and ask for

66
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,582
forgiveness?
Cheating went down dramatically.

67
00:03:57,582 --> 00:03:59,640
Now regrettably, later on, it went up
again.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,790
But at least for awhile, this idea of
opening new pages seemed to be effective.

69
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,847
And I think this is one of the things that
we can actually take from religion.

70
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:13,145
We can say, if religion has evolved to
help men deal with some of our challenges,

71
00:04:13,145 --> 00:04:17,382
some of our fallacies, some of our weak
points as human beings.

72
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:22,849
What can we learn from religion and should
we incorporate similar mechanism in other

73
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,223
places in society?
For example, should we create a

74
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:30,390
confession-like mechanism for citizens
submitting the IRS?

75
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:35,720
Should we create a confession-like
mechanism for some of our politicians for

76
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,708
some of our CEOs?
Is there something important in starting a

77
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,622
new page and allowing people to all of a
sudden reset the level of honesty and

78
00:04:44,622 --> 00:04:48,505
behave better?
And of course, a big scale version of this

79
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:54,081
was the Reconciliation Act in South
Africa, where they basically created the

80
00:04:54,081 --> 00:04:57,783
structure.
Where people basically, in, in, in a very

81
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:03,220
important public stage both ask for
forgiveness and started a new, a new page.

82
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,300
And you know, apartheid, apartheid is of
course a complex, difficult thing.

83
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,601
It will take a long time for anybody to
get over it completely.

84
00:05:11,601 --> 00:05:17,061
But it is taking these ideas of saying
you're sorry and starting a new page that

85
00:05:17,061 --> 00:05:22,467
might be important not just in religion,
but in civic society, in many cases.

86
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:26,474
Another question people ask me many times,
is what about cultural differences?

87
00:05:26,475 --> 00:05:30,780
We travel around the world, we see all
kinds of other cultures, some of us grew

88
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,194
up in a different culture.
And you can ask yourself, how is cheating

89
00:05:34,194 --> 00:05:37,470
different in different places.
So we try this out.

90
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,029
So I grew up in Israel, so the first thing
I did was to try Israel.

91
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,990
So what do you think?
Do the Israelis cheat more or less than

92
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,132
Americans?
Actually I'll tell you that when you ask

93
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:53,676
most people whether they think that people
in their home countries cheat more or less

94
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:56,579
than Americans.
Most people think that people in their

95
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:00,919
home countries cheat more than Americans,
aside from the Canadian and the northern

96
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,142
European countries.
And in general, when we ask people what do

97
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:07,799
you think, that Israeli cheat more or less
than Americans, most people say that the

98
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:10,440
Israelis probably cheat more but the
reality was not that.

99
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,216
We found that the Israelis were cheating
just the same as the Americans.

100
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:18,151
Francesca, my Italian, my Italian
collaborator said you want to see

101
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:22,380
cheating, come to Italy, we'll show you
what this cheating is all about.

102
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,584
We went to Italy, we tried the experiment
there.

103
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:29,348
Same results as in the States.
We tried Turkey, we tried England, we

104
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:32,670
tried Canada.
So far, we don't find any differences.

105
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,252
Now, we haven't tried everything, but so
far, we don't find any differences.

106
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:41,080
Now, how can it be that in one hand, when
you travel in other countries, or you grew

107
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,616
up in other countries, you feel the
cheating in different countries is very

108
00:06:45,616 --> 00:06:47,896
different.
On the other hand we don't find it in our

109
00:06:47,896 --> 00:06:50,940
experiment.
How would you balance these two views?

110
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,660
Is one of them right and is one of them
wrong?

111
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,050
No, I think they're both correct and here
is what I think happens.

112
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,877
Our experiments are basically without any
cultural context.

113
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:05,490
And therefore they check the basic fudge
factor.

114
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,470
And the fudge factor is in it's basic is
something we all share.

115
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,949
We can all rationalize about 15% of our
actions.

116
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,700
In a slightly moral way, and still feel of
ourself as good people.

117
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,738
So that's kind of the basic thing that is
similar across many people.

118
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:24,572
But culture is important, but what culture
does, it doesn't change your morality

119
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:29,207
across the whole range.
It attacks a particular domain.

120
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:33,744
Think about something like plagiarism.
Cheating on exams.

121
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:38,160
University cheating, different cultures
have said, oh, this is really important,

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,964
you can't cheat much.
Other cultures have said that is not a big

123
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,838
deal, you can cheat more.
Other cultures have said, this is not a

124
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,450
moral question.
It is not a part of the moral domain at

125
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,210
all, cheating in this case is just like
playing poker.

126
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,991
Don't worry about it.
What about infidelity?

127
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:53,894
Some cultures have said oh, this is a real
big issue.

128
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:56,229
Other countries have said this is not such
a big issue.

129
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,798
What about cheating on your taxes?
Issue or not issue.

130
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:05,090
Illegal downloads.
Buying fake counterfeit fashion product.

131
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:11,162
So basically what I think is going on, is
that there is this basic fudge fact that

132
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:14,240
we all share.
But the way it plays out in different

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,346
domains are influenced by culture.
Where the culture can either shrink or

134
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:21,450
expand the fudge factor.
And in some cases, it can even take a

135
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,100
particular behavior.
And say this is not a moral question.

136
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,792
In some countries with cultures with high
corruption, bribing a policeman is not

137
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:33,801
something that is immoral.
It is just, this is how you do business,

138
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,868
and so on.
So then we need to think about, both about

139
00:08:36,868 --> 00:08:41,568
the fudge factor, as well as about what
the effect of culture is on top of that.

140
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:46,578
I did find one experiment.
One experiment that showed a difference in

141
00:08:46,578 --> 00:08:51,147
cheating across cultures.
Every time we do these experiments, it's

142
00:08:51,147 --> 00:08:55,762
important to conduct them in a similar way
across different places.

143
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:59,723
So what we do is, we go to other
universities and we check students, or we

144
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:03,108
go to bars.
And when we go to bars, what we do is also

145
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:08,174
adjust the payment scale.
So a dollar in the states is not a dollar

146
00:09:08,174 --> 00:09:11,650
in, in India.
It's not a dollar, a dollar in England.

147
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:16,707
It's not a dollar in Turkey.
So what we do is we go to bars.

148
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:21,688
And we create a payment situation, such as
answering four questions will equal one

149
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:25,648
glass of beer.
So now, this is kind of our international

150
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,500
currency.
Every four questions is a glass of beer.

151
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,242
And the one place we found the difference
was when we went to a bar in Washington,

152
00:09:34,242 --> 00:09:38,077
D.C.
Where congressional staffers hang out.

153
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,222
And then we went to a bar in New York
where bankers hang out.

154
00:09:41,222 --> 00:09:44,952
And the question is, which one of those
two groups cheated more?

155
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,801
Now, I have to admit that I expected the
politicians to cheat more than the

156
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:51,167
bankers, but the results were the
opposite.

157
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:56,604
The banker cheated twice, two to one.
But I do have one word of caution, which

158
00:09:56,604 --> 00:10:02,264
is these were congressional staffers.
So these were junior politicians, and

159
00:10:02,264 --> 00:10:07,326
maybe over time there's room for growth in
terms of their dishonesty.
