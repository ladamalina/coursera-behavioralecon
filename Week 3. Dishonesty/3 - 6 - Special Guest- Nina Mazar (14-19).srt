1
00:00:08,50 --> 00:00:10,400
Good day. 
My name is Nina Mazar. 

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,926
And today, I want to talk to you about 
our model pendulum or how the social and 

3
00:00:14,926 --> 00:00:19,233
moral actions that we engaging in the 
here and now do not just happen in a 

4
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:26,580
vacuum, but actually effects our 
subsequent behaviors and decisions. 

5
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,928
So, let's first engage in a short 
exercise. 

6
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:33,384
I would like you to think about a recent 
situation where you were tempted to go 

7
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:39,520
against your social and moral beliefs, 
and where you gave into that temptation. 

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,258
How did that make you feel? 
And do you think it changed how you 

9
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:46,896
subsequently behaved? 
And if so, how, why? 

10
00:00:46,896 --> 00:00:52,144
Well, I recently passed by a group of 
students that was raising money for food 

11
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:56,396
bank. 
And here, I found myself being tempted to 

12
00:00:56,396 --> 00:01:00,149
be selfish because I was thirsty, I was 
tired. 

13
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,53
And I was thinking, oh, I could use the 
change to buy myself a warm cup of tea 

14
00:01:04,53 --> 00:01:08,85
and in that moment, I'm ashamed to say, 
it just felt like the better idea and I 

15
00:01:08,85 --> 00:01:13,870
went with the cup of tea. 
But once I had the cup of tea and I had a 

16
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,469
few sips, you know, I said, I feel bad 
about myself because that was not the 

17
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:23,108
person how I thought of myself. 
I have a different self image of myself 

18
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:27,76
and somehow, you know, it didn't feel 
right, I should have used my change to 

19
00:01:27,76 --> 00:01:31,310
actually donate that money to a good 
cause. 

20
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,160
So, without really understanding what was 
happening, I subsequently found myself 

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,568
being particularly nice to other people. 
I would hold the door open for the 

22
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:43,722
people, I would smile at other people, I 
would engage in small talk. 

23
00:01:43,722 --> 00:01:48,825
And what I was basically doing is I was 
compensating for my previous selfish 

24
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:54,690
behavior to reestablish my positive moral 
view of myself. 

25
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,730
And that's basically what a moral 
pendulum is. 

26
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,830
So, the good news is that we are, in 
general, motivated to do good things. 

27
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,575
And sometimes, when we transgress, you 
know, that happens once in a while 

28
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:08,480
because there are a lot of temptations 
around us. 

29
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,925
Then, we will be highly motivated to 
compensate for those transgressions, to 

30
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,935
reestablish the positive view of 
ourselves. 

31
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:23,380
Now unfortunately, the bad news is, a 
pendulum swings both ways. 

32
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,520
So, we are likely, least likely to 
scrutinize moral implications of our 

33
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
actions right after our moral self has 
just experienced a boost. 

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,86
So, after we have engaged in a virtuous 
act, a good act, a moral act, so a good 

35
00:02:36,86 --> 00:02:41,370
deed, it's highly likely that we feel 
very, very good about ourselves. 

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,232
As a consequence, we have earned 
ourselves some more credits or 

37
00:02:44,232 --> 00:02:47,850
credentials that license ourselves to 
subsequently be more selfish, if we find 

38
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,310
ourselves in a situation where we can 
benefit from them. 

39
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,778
And that's basically the question that my 
co-author, Chen-Bo Zhong and I, that we 

40
00:02:55,778 --> 00:02:58,940
wanted to test and we decided that we 
wanted to test it in the domain of green 

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,65
consumption. 
Because over the years, consumers have 

42
00:03:03,65 --> 00:03:07,110
become increasingly attentive to social 
and ethical conservations. 

43
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,530
And this includes, actually, my co-author 
and me. 

44
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:15,11
And so, we thought, well, maybe if people 
engage in green consumption and we 

45
00:03:15,11 --> 00:03:22,100
moralize green consumption, that might 
lead to a licensing effect. 

46
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,30
But before we went out to test that, we 
actually first ran a very quick survey. 

47
00:03:26,30 --> 00:03:31,295
We had half of our students rate how 
altruistic, how cooperative, how ethical 

48
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:38,170
they thought a person is that purchases 
conventional products. 

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,734
And we ask the other half of the students 
to rate how they thought of a person that 

50
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:45,82
purchases organic and, and, and 
environment-friendly products on those 

51
00:03:45,82 --> 00:03:49,930
same three dimensions. 
And what did we find? 

52
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,1
We actually did find that people thought 
that people who purchase green products, 

53
00:03:54,1 --> 00:03:58,131
environment-friendly products, organic 
products that they have higher moral and 

54
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:02,335
pro-social value. 
So, in all three dimensions that we had, 

55
00:04:02,335 --> 00:04:05,580
those people were rated higher than 
people who purchase conventional 

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,793
products. 
So, based on, on that observation, we 

57
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:12,185
thought, okay, green consumption might 
actually lead to a licensing effect 

58
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:17,410
further down the road. 
And here's how we went out to test it. 

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,650
So, we designed two online stores. 
One store that carried mainly 

60
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:26,850
conventional products, one store that 
carried mainly green products. 

61
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,632
Both stores had the same number of 
products, the same type of products, the 

62
00:04:30,632 --> 00:04:34,292
same prices, and we simply randomly 
assigned half of our students to one 

63
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:40,194
store, the other half to the other store. 
But the students didn't know that both 

64
00:04:40,194 --> 00:04:43,390
stores existed. 
They only saw this one store. 

65
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:47,359
And within each store type, half of our 
students were asked to simply browse 

66
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:51,202
through the store and then rate the 
products based on the design and on the 

67
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:57,587
informativeness of, of their description. 
While the other half was invited to 

68
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,515
purchase items. 
So, we asked them, choose products that 

69
00:05:00,515 --> 00:05:03,740
you would like to purchase and put them 
in your shopping cart. 

70
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,756
You can do this with up to $25 in value, 
and we told them that 1 in every 25 

71
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:10,240
students would be randomly selected to 
actually receive the items that they had 

72
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,50
in their cart for free from us. 
So, half of the students basically were 

73
00:05:16,50 --> 00:05:21,75
merely exposed to the products, while the 
other half of students, they actually 

74
00:05:21,75 --> 00:05:26,391
made purchasing decisions. 
So, that was the first part of the 

75
00:05:26,391 --> 00:05:29,274
experiment. 
And then, in the second part of the 

76
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:33,109
experiment, in an ostensibly unrelated 
task, we told participants that they 

77
00:05:33,109 --> 00:05:37,121
would engage in something that has been 
called the dictator game, actually, a 

78
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:42,920
variation of the dictator game. 
And what is the dictator game? 

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,818
Well, imagine you come to the lab and we 
tell you, you know what, you have been 

80
00:05:45,818 --> 00:05:50,150
paired with an anonymous other person 
that is sitting in a different room. 

81
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,261
You will never find out who that other 
person is and that other person will 

82
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:57,676
never find out who you are. 
And you know what, randomly you are now, 

83
00:05:57,676 --> 00:06:01,966
you have been selected to play the role 
of the dictator. 

84
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:06,126
And as a dictator, we've given you $6 for 
real, and you decide how much of the $6 

85
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:13,220
you want to keep for yourself versus give 
to the other person in the other room. 

86
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:17,230
So, you can decide, there is no right or 
wrong answer. 

87
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,834
And the nice thing about this very simple 
game is that since there isn't really any 

88
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,279
downside to not showing any money, 
because there are no social consequences, 

89
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,160
if you want, you can keep every, 
everything, so the entire $6. 

90
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,890
But if you do care about altruism, you 
will share. 

91
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:36,730
And so, it's a very nice simple task to 
measure how, how altruistic people are. 

92
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,490
So now, what did we find in our 
experimental session? 

93
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:43,946
We actually found that people who had 
just purchased in the green store, they 

94
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:47,672
ended up sharing significantly less money 
with their anonymous other person than 

95
00:06:47,672 --> 00:06:52,870
those participants who had just purchased 
in the conventional store. 

96
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,570
And that fits very nicely with that 
licensing hypothesis. 

97
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:59,408
So, the idea that those people who had 
just purchased green products, they felt 

98
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:02,720
very good about themselves. 
They pat themselves on the back. 

99
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,617
They felt morally superior. 
And that earned themself the license to 

100
00:07:06,617 --> 00:07:10,334
subsequently be a bit more selfish 
because it would not threaten their view 

101
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:16,12
that they had about themselves. 
Now, remember that we had a variation in 

102
00:07:16,12 --> 00:07:20,152
that purchasing task. 
Only half of our participants actually 

103
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:23,770
were purchasing, right, the other half 
was only exposed to the products, so they 

104
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,0
could not really engage in a good deed. 
And for those participants who are merely 

105
00:07:30,0 --> 00:07:35,250
exposed to the products, we actually did 
not find any licensing effect whatsoever. 

106
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:39,121
In fact, we actually found the opposite. 
So, people who were purchasing the green 

107
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:42,605
store, we're sharing significantly more 
money with the anonymous other person 

108
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:46,500
than those who had purchased in the 
conventional store. 

109
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,220
And that fits very nicely with something 
that has been coined, the priming effect. 

110
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,312
So, a priming effect happens when subtly 
cues in the environment activate 

111
00:07:55,312 --> 00:08:00,95
associated norms, that then lead to 
corresponding behavior. 

112
00:08:00,95 --> 00:08:04,757
So, for my opinion, two of the most or 
two of the coolest priming experiments 

113
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:11,476
show, for example, how exposure to the 
upper[UNKNOWN] increases creativity. 

114
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:16,100
And another one shows how exposure to 
pictures of exclusive upscale restaurants 

115
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:20,730
increase or improves people's eating 
manners. 

116
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:25,814
And, and I think along similar lines, 
people who have been exposed to green 

117
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:31,226
products being exposed to the green 
products activated those higher moral 

118
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:36,310
norms that people seem to have when it 
comes to green products and that lead 

119
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:45,352
them to behave consistently with those, 
with those beliefs and norms. 

120
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:49,330
Now, you can say, okay, so what? 
So, people who purchase in the green 

121
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:54,592
store, they were a bit less altruistic. 
But that's not necessarily a bad thing, 

122
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:57,515
right? 
And, you would be right if you're saying 

123
00:08:57,515 --> 00:08:59,408
that. 
But what my co-author and I were 

124
00:08:59,408 --> 00:09:02,762
wondering was, well, how strong can the 
licensing effect actually get? 

125
00:09:02,762 --> 00:09:07,784
What did even make people transgress in 
such a way that they would engage in 

126
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:14,60
clear immoral transgressions, such as 
lying or even stealing. 

127
00:09:14,60 --> 00:09:17,134
And that's what we tested in our second 
experiment. 

128
00:09:17,134 --> 00:09:20,460
So, again, we had our two stores, the 
conventional store and the green store. 

129
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:24,360
This time, we only ask participants to 
purchase in either of those two stores, 

130
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,664
it was the first part of the experiment. 
And then, in the second part of the 

131
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:32,360
experiment, the ostensibly unrelated 
task. 

132
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,750
We we asked them to participate in a 
computer-based visual perception task. 

133
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,490
So, how did that visual perception task 
look like? 

134
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,89
Imagine you're sitting in front of the 
computer, in front of the computer 

135
00:09:46,89 --> 00:09:50,720
screen, and you'll see a box or a square 
on that computer screen. 

136
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,27
And that square is divided by one 
diagonal line, and for one second, you 

137
00:09:55,27 --> 00:10:00,440
see 20 dots scattered inside that box, 
then they disappear. 

138
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,320
And you just simply have to say whether 
there more dots on the left or more dots 

139
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,660
on the right side of that diagonal line. 
And it, imagine further that there are 90 

140
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,360
such trials, and on each trial, the 
pattern of the dots is, is very 

141
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,856
different. 
Now what happens, oh, I actually should 

142
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:17,366
say that people are extremely good at 
this task, they're very, very accurate, 

143
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,249
because of, our visual perception is 
fairly good. 

144
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,891
But now, what happens when we introduce a 
payment scheme such that every time you 

145
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:30,130
say that there are more dots on the left, 
you earn half a cent. 

146
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,532
Every time you say that there are more 
dots on the right, you earn 10 times the 

147
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:37,693
amount, 5 cents. 
So, now I bet, oh, and let's imagine that 

148
00:10:37,693 --> 00:10:43,20
the computer pays you regardless if your 
answer is correct or not. 

149
00:10:43,20 --> 00:10:46,140
So now, I bet when you see that there are 
more dots on the lower pay side, you will 

150
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,20
find yourself tempted to just simply say, 
hey, there are more dots on the 

151
00:10:49,20 --> 00:10:55,174
right-hand side, so the higher pay side. 
And, and so that you earn more money. 

152
00:10:55,174 --> 00:10:59,103
And that's what we wanted to see. 
We wanted to see would people cheat for 

153
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:02,110
more money. 
What did we find? 

154
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:06,205
Well, consistent with the licensing 
effect, people who had just purchased in 

155
00:11:06,205 --> 00:11:10,363
the green store, well, they actually 
ended up cheating significantly more for 

156
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:15,410
higher pay than those people in the 
conventional store. 

157
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,258
Actually, in fact, the people in the 
conventioal store were completely honest. 

158
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:21,737
And, and not only that. 
So, once the computer task was over, 

159
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:25,580
participants would see on the final 
screen how much money they earned and 

160
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,612
they were instructed to pay themselves 
out of an envelope with cash that they 

161
00:11:29,612 --> 00:11:35,6
would find on their desk. 
And what we wanted to see is, would 

162
00:11:35,6 --> 00:11:38,830
people take out the amount of money that 
they see on the screen? 

163
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,720
Or would they overpay themselves? 
So, basically steal some money from us. 

164
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,271
And again, people who had just purchased 
in a green store also took out more money 

165
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:51,136
than what they were supposed to. 
So overall, because of lying and because 

166
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:55,426
of stealing, people in the green store 
overpaid themselves by about $0.83 more 

167
00:11:55,426 --> 00:12:00,10
than those participants in a conventional 
store. 

168
00:12:00,10 --> 00:12:04,400
And that might not seem like a lot, but 
it is a lot. 

169
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,353
When you think about that, if people were 
completely honest and accurate in that 

170
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:12,810
visual perception task, they would have 
made only about $2. 

171
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:19,714
So, what's the morale of this research 
that I just presented to you? 

172
00:12:19,714 --> 00:12:23,806
Well, if you're about to say that green 
people are bad people, that they are 

173
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:29,560
immoral and not social, think again, 
because that is not the takeaway. 

174
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,954
So, it's not the takeaway simply because 
we did not compare green people to 

175
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:39,576
non-green people. 
We had the same group of students and we 

176
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:43,615
just randomly assinged them to one store 
or the other store. 

177
00:12:43,615 --> 00:12:48,453
So, the takeaway of our experiment is 
that if you engage in actions that 

178
00:12:48,453 --> 00:12:53,701
produce a sense of moral, of moral glow 
that make you feel superior that then, 

179
00:12:53,701 --> 00:13:00,10
you are more likely to subsequently 
transgress. 

180
00:13:00,10 --> 00:13:03,941
So, you license yourself for, to 
transgress further down the road. 

181
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:08,760
So, as long we engage in behaviors that 
we moralize, such as, for example, 

182
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,830
purchasing green products, we will find 
the licensing effect. 

183
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,509
But if we do not moralize green 
consumption, if we were to engage in it 

184
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:20,423
just because it is, it feels like the 
right thing to do, it is a norm, we don't 

185
00:13:20,423 --> 00:13:25,945
pat ourselves on the back. 
Then, we would not expect the licensing 

186
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:30,120
effect of then we would not expect to 
find the licensing effect. 

187
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,190
The licensing effect requires that you 
feel a boost to your self-concept. 

188
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,320
So, the good news is that many of us 
wanted a good and that many of us think 

189
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,530
of themselves as good pro-social and as 
moral human beings. 

190
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,824
We just need a bit, we just need to be a 
bit cautious about, when we engage in 

191
00:13:46,824 --> 00:13:50,118
good behaviors, that we don't feel 
superior, and that we don't feel like, 

192
00:13:50,118 --> 00:13:55,282
that we have done enough. 
Because if we feel that way, then we will 

193
00:13:55,282 --> 00:13:59,314
be less motivated to continue doing good 
and we'll be more likely to license 

194
00:13:59,314 --> 00:14:03,840
ourselves to transgress further down the 
road. 

195
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,390
And I think even the most ethical ones 
among us, they can benefit from such kind 

196
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,522
of a self-reflection from time to time. 
And that's basically all I have to tell 

197
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:19,656
you about the moral pendulum. 
Thank you.
