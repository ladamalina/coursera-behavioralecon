1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,56
Mike Andrews had a very difficult 
decision to make. 

2
00:00:09,56 --> 00:00:11,770
He was a patient of mine in the hospital 
who had been admitted with acute 

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,622
leukemia, that meant his white blood 
cells had turned into cancer and were 

4
00:00:14,622 --> 00:00:19,86
threatening to end his life. 
In fact, there was not doubt his life was 

5
00:00:19,86 --> 00:00:22,20
not going to be A very long one at this 
point. 

6
00:00:22,20 --> 00:00:26,212
We was in his mid 50s and he had a few 
days, weeks, maybe months to live. 

7
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:30,500
He would either die of leukemia or of the 
treatment for leukemia, and therein lay 

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,540
his choice. 
He had to decide whether to take 

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,740
chemotherapy that had the potential to 
extend his life but not cure him of the 

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,426
leukemia... 
But was definitely going to make him 

11
00:00:40,426 --> 00:00:44,330
miserable in the process. 
And might even shorten his life. 

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:45,710
So he had this difficult decision to 
make. 

13
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,550
I'm Peter Ubel. 
I'm a physician at Duke University. 

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,420
I tell Andrew's story in my book, 
Critical Decisions. 

15
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,128
I wanted to tell you now. 
Are some of the ways that medical 

16
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:57,340
decisions differ from other decisions we 
face in life. 

17
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,45
I will use Andrews' story as part of the 
way to get into this really fascinating 

18
00:01:01,45 --> 00:01:04,636
topic of how medical decisions raise 
questions and issues and unconscious 

19
00:01:04,636 --> 00:01:11,80
irrational forces that aren't necessarily 
there in other decisions we face in life. 

20
00:01:11,80 --> 00:01:14,934
So, Andrews had this choice. 
Does he take chemotherapy, at the risk of 

21
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:17,880
shortening his life and making himself 
miserable? 

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,625
Or does he just get comfort care to 
relieve the pain and suffering from his 

23
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:23,640
leukemia and live the last few months of 
his life without going through terrible 

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,345
treatments? 
Before he can make that decision, though, 

25
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:32,590
he needed 1 more piece of information. 
He needed to know the odds would, would 

26
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:37,501
respond to the chemotherapy. 
And that depended on the results of 

27
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:42,582
genetic testings of his leukemia. 
The test results came back and I met with 

28
00:01:42,582 --> 00:01:46,540
the oncologists, the cancer doctors, 
outside Mr. 

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,298
Andrews' room to talk about the results 
and they weren't good. 

30
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:52,558
The oncologists looked me in the eye and 
said it's bad news. 

31
00:01:52,558 --> 00:01:56,782
At best, there's a 5% chance his leukemia 
will respond to the treatment. 

32
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,718
Terrible news. 
So we went to the bedside. 

33
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:03,55
The oncologist sat down next to Mr. 
Andrews and explained what chemotherapy 

34
00:02:03,55 --> 00:02:06,268
would entail, the fact that he wouldn't 
be cured no matter what happened, et 

35
00:02:06,268 --> 00:02:09,250
cetera. 
Andrews understood this all. 

36
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,282
He said but doc, I want to know what are 
the odds that my cancer will respond to 

37
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:17,526
the chemotherapy? 
The oncologist took a deep breath and 

38
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:21,430
said 20%, Mr. 
Andrews, 20% chance that you'll respond. 

39
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,150
He said well those are fighting odds. 
Let's go for it. 

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,970
We left the room and the oncologist 
signed the orders for the chemotherapy. 

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,856
What happened here? 
Well I'm going to get to his story a 

42
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:33,754
little bit more but let me tell you about 
just a number of factors that went in 

43
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:37,740
here. 
That's, that highlight how weird medical 

44
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,716
decision can be, medical decision making 
can be. 

45
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:44,610
It starts with the fact that we're often 
asking patients to make decisions that 

46
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,209
are unlike any decisions they faced in 
their lives, and that force them to 

47
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,220
imagine the unimaginable, to predict the 
unpredictable. 

48
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,405
To imagine what it's like to experience 
something they've never experienced 

49
00:02:56,405 --> 00:03:00,20
before. 
In fact in Mr Andrews case that began 

50
00:03:00,20 --> 00:03:04,850
with the bone marrow biopsy we used to 
diagnose him with leukemia. 

51
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,190
A bone marrow biopsy and I sorry to have 
to describe this to you even, it's 

52
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,151
painful even to just here about it. 
It involves taking a needle about the 

53
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:15,55
size of my pinky, and burring it into a 
person's hip bone which we try to numb up 

54
00:03:15,55 --> 00:03:20,410
with medicine, but frankly we never can 
cover up all the pain. 

55
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,875
And in Andrew's case, was the most 
painful thing he said he'd experienced in 

56
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,981
his entire life. 
As much as we did to try to help him 

57
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:30,426
imagine what it would be like to get a 
bone morrow barrow, a bone marrow biopsy, 

58
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:35,936
it was beyond the, his worst fears. 
we got that then, and it showed that when 

59
00:03:35,936 --> 00:03:39,338
you're trying to decide should I get a 
boner biopsy or not, your doctor might 

60
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:43,10
tell you what it will feel like, but that 
doesn't mean your going to understand and 

61
00:03:43,10 --> 00:03:46,358
really grasp what it will feel like, and 
in his case it was worse than what he 

62
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:52,122
expected. 
In most medical decisions, the thing we 

63
00:03:52,122 --> 00:03:56,920
ask patients to imagine Are not as bad as 
they imagined they would be. 

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,758
For example people imagined if they had 
kidney failure and had to go to dialysis 

65
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,708
a few times a week. 
And have their blood pulled out into a 

66
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:06,446
machine and put back into their body. 
That they'd be miserable in that 

67
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:08,596
situation. 
We had, I, in my research I've asked the 

68
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:10,876
general public what do you think your 
life would be like if you had kidney 

69
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:15,715
failure and needed dialysis? 
And people imagine being in negative 

70
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:20,424
moods the majority of their waking hours. 
But when you actually measure the moods 

71
00:04:20,424 --> 00:04:23,304
of people who have kidney failure, giving 
them beepers that even beep at 

72
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,970
intermittent periods during the day 
they'll say what's your mood right now? 

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,956
We find that people are happy the 
majority of the time. 

74
00:04:30,956 --> 00:04:34,56
And in fact you can't tell the difference 
in the moods of people with kidney 

75
00:04:34,56 --> 00:04:37,406
failure going to dialysis three times a 
week facing a 20% mortality rate because 

76
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:41,160
of the serious of their, of their 
illness. 

77
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,446
You can't tell the difference between 
their moods and the moods of healthy 

78
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:47,328
people. 
People have an ability to emotionally 

79
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,892
adapt to chronic illness and disability 
beyond what they imagine they could do 

80
00:04:50,892 --> 00:04:56,550
and when making medical decisions. 
People often don't recognize how much 

81
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,936
they'll adapt. 
And that can lead them to make bad 

82
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:01,330
decisions. 
So let's challenge one. 

83
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:04,878
How do you help a patient? 
Imagine what their life will be like if a 

84
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:08,220
or b or c happen. 
And a and b or c are unfamiliar health 

85
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,160
states they've never experienced. 
Now Mr. 

86
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,851
Andrews case. 
He had to imagine what it would be like 

87
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:19,10
to go through chemotherapy. 
We did our best to describe that to him. 

88
00:05:19,10 --> 00:05:23,365
The second thing we needed to do then was 
to help him decide in this midst of what 

89
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:28,370
was very high stakes decision, literally 
life or death. 

90
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,280
And that's the second real difference 
between medical decisions. 

91
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,580
And many other decisions in life, the 
stakes are so much higher. 

92
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,920
Now, funny things happen when people are 
faced with medical high stakes decisions, 

93
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,380
especially ones involving cancer. 
They feel like they have to do something, 

94
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,110
regardless of whether it's in their best 
interests. 

95
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,338
I'll give you an example. 
We ask people to imagine They had a slow 

96
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:54,10
growing cancer inside their bodies that, 
that cancer if it was left untreated and 

97
00:05:54,10 --> 00:05:57,466
watched for awhile and only treated 
aggressively if it expanded would have a 

98
00:05:57,466 --> 00:06:01,30
5% chance of ending their lives we also 
told them we could take that cancer right 

99
00:06:01,30 --> 00:06:04,540
out with a surgery that the surgery would 
cure them of the cancer they wouldn't 

100
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:12,850
have to worry about the cancer anymore. 
But the surgery was quite risky, 10% 

101
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,990
chance they would die of the surgery. 
So, in the one hand 5% chance of dying of 

102
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,900
cancer, other hand 10% chance of dying of 
surgery. 

103
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,176
Majority of people said, "Give me the 
surgery and get it out of me." Almost an 

104
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:31,220
action imperative kicked in, when the C 
word, cancer came at people. 

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,665
They would anything they could to get rid 
of it even if it seems to defy logic and 

106
00:06:34,665 --> 00:06:38,450
rationale. 
So that's part another way that medical 

107
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,514
decisions are different. 
The stakes are high and especially when 

108
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:47,765
the diagnoses we even talk about, things 
like cancer, create such strong emotions. 

109
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:53,230
They compel people to take action. 
Even if, potentially, it'd be better to 

110
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,228
stand back and do something less than 
that most aggressive care. 

111
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:00,994
Alright. 
So, what other things could effect the 

112
00:07:00,994 --> 00:07:04,420
kind of decisions that Mr. 
Andrews faced in this case. 

113
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,70
Another is he needed information to guide 
his decision. 

114
00:07:08,70 --> 00:07:11,590
And one of the differences between many 
decisions we face in life and medical 

115
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,55
decisions is that in medical decisions 
you rely on the doctros often to help 

116
00:07:15,55 --> 00:07:20,554
you, to inform you about your choices. 
That creates problems where doctors don't 

117
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:23,920
know how to speak in a language their 
patients can understand. 

118
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,672
I've found that even with my primary care 
patients when I'd talk to them about 

119
00:07:26,672 --> 00:07:30,813
their blood pressure. 
I assume that they knew that the blood 

120
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:34,417
pressure meant that the force pushing 
against their arterial walls was elevated 

121
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:38,868
because their arteries were stiff. 
And that created problems like risk of 

122
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:42,906
heart attack or stroke. 
To them, the word pressure meant nervous 

123
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:46,312
and anxiety, anxious. 
And so they only thought they needed to 

124
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:49,100
take blood pressure pills When they were 
nervous or anxious, when they were under 

125
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,32
pressure. 
And so fact that I used a word that meant 

126
00:07:52,32 --> 00:07:55,82
one thing to me and meant something 
different to my patients, lead them to 

127
00:07:55,82 --> 00:07:59,255
make bad decisions. 
So, skip blood pressure pills they needed 

128
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:02,0
to take everyday. 
So we physicians have to educate our 

129
00:08:02,0 --> 00:08:05,530
patients in language they can understand. 
That's often a big challenge. 

130
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,210
Mr. 
Andrew's story reveals another challenge. 

131
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,436
We also have to give you accurate 
information. 

132
00:08:12,436 --> 00:08:15,442
In Mr. 
Andrews case, a 5% chance that his 

133
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:20,656
leukemia would respond to chemotherapy 
and yet the oncologist told him that it 

134
00:08:20,656 --> 00:08:24,350
was 20% odds. 
Is that a lie? 

135
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:30,42
Well here I want just tell you. 
It's not just patients who are prone to 

136
00:08:30,42 --> 00:08:35,930
strange decisions in medical contexts. 
We physicians are prone to those too. 

137
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,610
And I don't think that that oncologist 
lied. 

138
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,622
I think that oncologist when asked 
straight up front what are my odds of 

139
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:47,590
getting benefit from the chemo had that 
5% number in her head. 

140
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,942
And immediately started recalculating 
because it's so hard to give someone such 

141
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,962
dismal news. 
So she probably thought, hmm, you know, 

142
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,910
for five precent but he's younger than 
the average leukemia patient, he seems to 

143
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,638
be a fighter and, you know, maybe the, 
maybe the studies who told me the five 

144
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:03,498
percent number are a little bit old, 
maybe the treatments are better than they 

145
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:08,710
were. 
All of a sudden that five became 20. 

146
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,590
And if she was lying to anyone, I think 
the oncologist was lying to herself. 

147
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,208
Because imagine if you were taking care 
of people with advanced cancer day in and 

148
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,556
day out wouldn't you want to convince 
yourself that they all had a fighting 

149
00:09:19,556 --> 00:09:24,8
chance. 
And so here we are, in fact studies have 

150
00:09:24,8 --> 00:09:28,83
shown, if you as doctors. 
With patients who have advanced cancer 

151
00:09:28,83 --> 00:09:31,280
you ask their doctors how long do you 
think they have to live. 

152
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,950
They say oh they have this long to live. 
Look at the actual evidence. 

153
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,12
They only live this long. 
They overestimate how long their patients 

154
00:09:38,12 --> 00:09:41,410
have to live because they have to see 
hope in the situation. 

155
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:44,290
Then you ask the doctors well if the 
patient asked how long would you tell 

156
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:47,248
them they have to live. 
And they said oh I'd tell them they have 

157
00:09:47,248 --> 00:09:49,520
this long to live. 
So here we are. 

158
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,804
Here's how long they live. 
Here's how long the doctors think they 

159
00:09:51,804 --> 00:09:54,110
live. 
Here's what the doctors say. 

160
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,700
You can see that gap getting bigger and 
bigger. 

161
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,508
And yet that is the information patients 
need, to make decisions like Mr.Andrews 

162
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:04,130
faced, on whether to take chemotherapy. 
We rely on, good information, but 

163
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:09,674
psychology can get in the way of that. 
So, we've seen several things that differ 

164
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:13,945
between medical decisions. 
And regular, and other decisions in the 

165
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,840
world. 
Unfamiliar situations. 

166
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,210
High stakes. 
A dependence on the doctor for 

167
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,286
information. 
Where the doctor might already be biased 

168
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,650
about what information to give you. 
The final difference is, we often come to 

169
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,112
doctors for advice. 
And here's how that works. 

170
00:10:26,112 --> 00:10:29,708
Let's go back to that cancer scenario 
where I said you had a cancer inside of 

171
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:33,270
you. 
5% chance you'll die of the cancer, 10% 

172
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,782
chance you'll die of the surgery. 
You ask people to make that decision and 

173
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:41,318
they say, oh yeah I'll have the surgery. 
If you ask people to recommend a 

174
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:44,763
treatment for a friend they say, don't 
get the surgery, take your chance on the 

175
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:48,704
cancer. 
We find the same thing happens with 

176
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:50,680
doctors. 
They make 1 set of decisions for 

177
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,988
themselves. 
But when making, giving advice to 

178
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:56,360
patients, they give a whole 'nother set 
of recommendations. 

179
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,640
We weigh things differently, risks and 
benefits when we're deciding for ourself. 

180
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,846
When we're deciding for others. 
Another factor that affects medical 

181
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,510
decisions. 
So let me tell you what happened with Mr. 

182
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,623
Andrews. 
He said he wanted the chemotherapy. 

183
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:11,520
We walked out of the room. 
I was stunned that the oncologist had 

184
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,420
changed that 5% number to 20% and I 
couldn't let him get that treatment 

185
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,264
without going back in and seeing what he 
really needed. 

186
00:11:18,264 --> 00:11:21,155
So I went back in the room and I said to 
him, I just explored his views, his 

187
00:11:21,155 --> 00:11:24,308
values, understood where he was coming 
from. 

188
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,556
And I said well let's suppose, just 
suppose on the off chance that that 

189
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:31,880
chemotherapy had only a One percent 
chance of benefiting you. 

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,922
Would you still do it? 
And he said yes, my, my lover in the 

191
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:39,38
past, died of AIDS. 
And he would he was a fighter to the end 

192
00:11:39,38 --> 00:11:43,310
and he'd want me to fight all the way. 
So even if it was just a 1% chance, I'd 

193
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,947
still take the treatment. 
At that point I was comfortable with him 

194
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,609
undergoing the therapy. 
And went along with the decision. 

195
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,412
So, if you want to learn more, again, 
read critical decisions. 

196
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:58,52
But certainly you want to understand that 
all the things you learn about irrational 

197
00:11:58,52 --> 00:12:01,536
forces that can affect decisions and many 
domains in your life are brought up to a 

198
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:06,20
whole new level when it's medical context 
in your life. 

199
00:12:06,20 --> 00:12:09,173
Thanks very much and have a good day.
