1
00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:19,567
[music] Hello, hello.
I'm Aline.

2
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:23,392
That was funny because Dan says hello,
hello.

3
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:29,322
You probably don't know that yet, but you
will learn over the course of this course.

4
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:32,338
>> And I'm Susan.
>> And we're going to show you how to get

5
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:35,878
around this website.
>> To get to the home tab, you click on

6
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:39,170
the upper left on the big tab that says
home.

7
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,350
That will fill in as the course progresses
with announcements like these, videos and

8
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,674
other things that you'll see as the course
progresses.

9
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:52,316
On the right side your going to see fill
in with quizzes and other upcoming

10
00:00:52,316 --> 00:00:55,812
assignments to let you know what is going
on this week.

11
00:00:55,812 --> 00:00:58,030
>> Just below home you'll find the video
lectures.

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:02,322
You may have even found this video there.
The video lectures are going to be

13
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,534
separated by topic and week.
So every week has it's own topic.

14
00:01:06,535 --> 00:01:11,970
As you can see here, week one, we're going
to cover rationality, week two, we'll look

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,150
at the psychology of money, week three, is
all about dishonesty, week four, we get to

16
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,738
labor and motivation, week five, is all
about self control, and week six is

17
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:23,970
emotion.
These videos build on each other, so

18
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,994
you're probably going to want to watch
them in succession, and you can't really

19
00:01:26,994 --> 00:01:29,899
skip ahead because we're only going to
post them one week at a time.

20
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,408
We have some special guest lecturers, so
every week you'll hear a bit about

21
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:41,456
different topics, and these will hopefully
add to Dan's perspective on the topic of

22
00:01:41,456 --> 00:01:44,304
that week.
You can also download these videos if you

23
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:48,269
have a slow internet connection or you
just want to take it with you wherever you

24
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:53,829
go, and show your friends and family.
There are subtitles as well although it

25
00:01:53,829 --> 00:02:00,339
may be a little harder to understand with
the subtitles given the Dan-speak and your

26
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:07,221
brain can more easily process information
when, when you translate it automatically

27
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:12,420
into human English.
Now we also have the ability to speed up

28
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,498
videos.
So, if you're in a rush, you want to watch

29
00:02:15,498 --> 00:02:20,482
something in, 1.5 time.
Unfortunately we can't do double time, but

30
00:02:20,482 --> 00:02:23,917
1.5 is just as good.
Then you can do that as well.

31
00:02:23,918 --> 00:02:26,755
Next we have the reading assignments, just
below the video lectures.

32
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:32,119
Here, you'll find both the required and
the recommended readings.

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,489
The required readings are going to be on
the quizzes, if you decide to take the

34
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,170
quizzes.
Which we hope you do because actually they

35
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,787
are pretty amusing, according to me and
Susan.

36
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:47,900
And these are really meant to get you to
think, to question their findings outside

37
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,072
of what they're given at face value.
And by doing so, reading through that and

38
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:57,890
you can learn a bit about how research in
behavioral economics is done, and also

39
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:02,427
just start thinking more like a scientist.
>> Quizzes are the next tab down.

40
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,983
We have 2 types of quizzes for this
course.

41
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:09,442
Although in the lecture you'll also be
getting quizzes, those are just there to

42
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:14,894
make sure you haven't fallen asleep.
The first type of quiz that you're going

43
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:19,318
to be taking is based on lecture.
The second type is based on the required

44
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:23,961
readings for each weeks and you'll be able
to find those under readings.

45
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:29,730
That's it, pretty self explanatory.
>> Now we've come to the discussion for a

46
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,368
yes, I said fora not forums.
This is where you'll have the most

47
00:03:33,368 --> 00:03:37,250
interaction with your fellow students.
There's place for everything on the

48
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,346
discussion boards, introductions,
lectures, assignments, study groups,

49
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,057
feedback and there is even a place for
things that don't have a place.

50
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,974
So, if you have a question about one of
the readings or the lectures, if you're

51
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:52,196
having technical difficulties or even if
just want to say, hey.

52
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:55,343
This is the place to do it.
>> The main point we want to make about

53
00:03:55,343 --> 00:03:58,172
the discussion boards is that they need to
be self-sustaining.

54
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:02,925
As much as Aline and I would like to be
there all the time, we can't monitor these

55
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:05,747
24, 7.
So, when you have a question, search for

56
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:09,310
it and highlight it.
The key is to help out your peers and most

57
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,109
of all, be nice.
Nobody likes a troll.

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,939
>> One crucial feature of the discussion
fora is their role in shaping Dan's weekly

59
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,080
office hours.
So every week, we'll take your questions

60
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,560
and your discussion points and we'll pose
our favorite ones to Dan, and he'll

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,264
respond.
We'll post that video online, and you can

62
00:04:26,264 --> 00:04:29,462
see his answers to all sorts of questions
that you come up with.

63
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:32,875
To submit a question for office hours, all
you need to do is add the office hours tag

64
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:36,166
to your post.
This literally mean that all you have to

65
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:40,818
do is type office hours in the tag base.
>> We have one short writing assignment in

66
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:44,881
this course and you'll see it in the tab
to the left labeled writing assignment.

67
00:04:44,882 --> 00:04:48,264
If you choose to do this and we highly
recommend that you do.

68
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:51,452
You won't just be a writer, you will also
be a grader.

69
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:56,316
It's impossible for the two of us to grade
all of your essays, and we have no way of

70
00:04:56,316 --> 00:05:00,254
automatically doing it.
So we're relying on you to make this work.

71
00:05:00,254 --> 00:05:04,368
Fortunately we know from other courses
that people seem to enjoy both aspects of

72
00:05:04,368 --> 00:05:12,620
this, both the writing and the grading.
>> You might also see a button that says,

73
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,547
Don't Click Here.
What's that all about?

74
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:19,908
Looks dangerous.
You probably don't want to click that.

75
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,524
>> Next are the Abouts which give you all
sorts of information of this course.

76
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:29,220
Within the, About this course section, is
a lot more information that you'll want to

77
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,037
go over.
First is the description section which has

78
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:36,634
an overview of the course.
Next, is the format which has more

79
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:40,654
information about finding your way around
the site and what to do once you're on a

80
00:05:40,654 --> 00:05:43,701
tab.
Next is the Timeline which has our

81
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:47,389
schedule.
Then the Assignments and Assessments which

82
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,662
has more about grading.
And finally we have a section on Dan And

83
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:56,933
You and that tells you how to relate and
communicate with the course staff.

84
00:05:56,933 --> 00:06:00,900
There are lots of you.
Please don't email us, we can't handle it.

85
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,719
Please use the discussion fora.
>> In the second about, you can learn all

86
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:08,518
about us.
Not just Dan, but Susan and myself and our

87
00:06:08,518 --> 00:06:11,754
TA's.
I guess that makes them TAA's?

88
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:17,412
But really, there's a pretty remarkable
crew behind this entire course, from

89
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:20,720
designing the videos to designing the
site.

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,726
And, you know, I'm not even going to get
into it.

91
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:29,178
[laugh] Everyone deserves a shout out, and
you should give them some props because

92
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:32,850
they're awesome.
>> The third and last About is all about

93
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,705
you.
Because this class is offered

94
00:06:34,705 --> 00:06:38,894
internationally, we have students from all
over the world, and we really like for you

95
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:43,240
all to be represented on a map.
To make sure that happens, please fill out

96
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,217
the initial survey that we've emailed to
all of you so that we can get your

97
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:53,069
location data and put you all up on a map.
>> Now, for some super fun features of

98
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:57,668
this class, the course Wiki is another
place for you to learn cool things and

99
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:01,610
make your mark.
We've set it up for you with a bunch of

100
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:07,337
awesome contents, links to outside sources
and some videos and even some other

101
00:07:07,337 --> 00:07:10,996
articles.
And there's a glossary that will be super

102
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:16,540
helpful for you if you don't understand
what, you know, hedonic calculus is, or

103
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,748
Dan throws in some, some terms in his
lectures that you just don't quite get

104
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:27,838
right away, refer to the glossary, we've
dumped a bunch of things there for you to,

105
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:32,612
to help you out.
But really this, this is a place for you

106
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:40,024
to add, your own character for you to put
in things that excite you and you think

107
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:44,649
are relevant to the course.
So of course this will change over time,

108
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,895
but let's look at the Wiki as it is now.
It's divided into the weekly topics of the

109
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:52,801
course, so you see we have the main page
with all the topics and some more fun

110
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:57,585
stuff down here.
But really, you should explore, have fun.

111
00:07:57,585 --> 00:08:02,207
>> Finally, the last tab on your left, is
the meet up tab.

112
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:07,580
Meet up is a great tool for coursera, it
allows you to arrange to meet people in

113
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,970
person.
For anything from reading groups to Nerdy

114
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,930
behavior like[UNKNOWN] parties, you can
dress up as your favorite social

115
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,657
scientist.
>> That's it for the site tour.

116
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:23,500
You probably could have learned just as
much by clicking around, but hopefully you

117
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,458
enjoyed yourself and got to know us a
little better in the process.

118
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:30,886
And just remember, we're here for you.
Chicka, chicka.

119
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:35,474
>> [inaudible].
>> Learn cool things guys.
