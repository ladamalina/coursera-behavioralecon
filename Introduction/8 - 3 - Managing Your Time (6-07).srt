1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,246
You're probably starting this class 
thinking that you're going to do all the 

2
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:05,510
work. 
You're going to be a great student. 

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,590
You're going to start by watching all the 
videos. 

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,680
You're going to take the quizzes. 
You're going to do readings. 

5
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,720
You're going to take the readings 
quizzes. 

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:17,559
And, you'll be 100% with the class. 
Except that you're human, just like all 

7
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,540
the rest of us. 
So probably, you'll procrastinate. 

8
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:24,359
You're about to do the readings and your 
friend calls you at the movie you've been 

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,121
hearing about, or the trampoline gym, or 
just wants to go out for drinks and hang 

10
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:30,538
out. 
It happens to all of us. 

11
00:00:30,538 --> 00:00:33,610
But, procrastination doesn't have to be 
counterproductive. 

12
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:38,550
For example, as I'm making this video, 
I'm thinking about finishing the quizzes. 

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,44
I really should finish the quizzes. 
A big contributor to procrastination is 

14
00:00:45,44 --> 00:00:48,170
what Kahneman and Tversky would call the 
planning fallacy. 

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,724
Basically, the planning fallacy says that 
even when we have a lot of experience 

16
00:00:52,724 --> 00:00:56,864
with something, we still tend to 
underestimate the amount of time it'll 

17
00:00:56,864 --> 00:00:59,955
take us. 
This explains a whole lot, for example, 

18
00:00:59,955 --> 00:01:04,180
why are they running 10 minutes late to 
everything this week, even though, I go 

19
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,793
to these places all the time. 
Think about the last time you had an 

20
00:01:07,793 --> 00:01:12,8
assignment to do or a trip to pack for. 
Did you find yourself right up agaist the 

21
00:01:12,8 --> 00:01:15,976
deadline, did you find yourself staying 
up all night to pack, and forgetting 

22
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:19,907
something like an adaptor? 
This is pretty common. 

23
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:24,867
So, the next time you have something to 
plan for, an assignment or a quiz for 

24
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:30,147
example, try estimating, it'll take you 
twice as long and then it might get done 

25
00:01:30,147 --> 00:01:30,816
on time. 

26
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:34,870
 >> Deadlines are important. 
Now, of course, you already knew that. 

27
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:39,158
But, I'm going to really drill it in for 
you by telling you about some researches 

28
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:41,710
that Dan conducted with Klaus 
Wertenbroch. 

29
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,545
This is actually in one of your assigned 
readings for week five on self-control. 

30
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,846
But I'm just going to give you a little 
preview. 

31
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:51,866
This study basically looked at whether 
people spontaneously set deadlines for 

32
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,460
themselves, and if they do, how optimally 
they set these deadlines. 

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,78
Dan and Klaus let some students choose 
their own deadlines for three papers that 

34
00:01:59,78 --> 00:02:01,0
were going to be due at the end of the 
term. 

35
00:02:01,0 --> 00:02:05,355
And for the other students, they had to 
abide by these preset deadlines that were 

36
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:09,200
spaced evenly throughout. 
For those who are allowed to choose their 

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,720
own deadlines, the rational thing to do 
would be to set them all on the due date 

38
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,3
and not a minute earlier. 
After all, they can always turn in their 

39
00:02:16,3 --> 00:02:20,95
papers early and this would give them the 
maximum amount of time to work on each. 

40
00:02:20,95 --> 00:02:24,142
But, the students had some intuition that 
they would run into self-control problems 

41
00:02:24,142 --> 00:02:28,294
and probably procrastinate. 
And, so they, they sort of distributed 

42
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:32,127
their papers throughout the term. 
So far, great. 

43
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:36,50
But, did they distribute these deadlines 
optimally? 

44
00:02:36,50 --> 00:02:39,182
Not quite. 
If we take a look at the performance of 

45
00:02:39,182 --> 00:02:42,562
those who impose their own deadlines and 
those who are given deadlines, we see 

46
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:45,545
that on average, the second group scored 
higher on their papers. 

47
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:49,385
So far it looks like self-imposed 
deadlines are just not as effective as 

48
00:02:49,385 --> 00:02:53,254
externally imposed deadlines. 
But, when we look a little closer at the 

49
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:57,544
group that set their own deadlines, we 
can see that the students among them who 

50
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,636
set evenly spaced deadlines actually did 
just as well as those in the other 

51
00:03:01,636 --> 00:03:04,157
condition. 
It doesn't really matter who sets the 

52
00:03:04,157 --> 00:03:06,295
deadlines, just that they're evenly 
spaced. 

53
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:10,68
So, bottom line, in the face of 
self-control problems like 

54
00:03:10,68 --> 00:03:12,792
procrastination, smart deadlines help. 

55
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:19,350
 >> Are you a Sponge or are you a Roomba? 
We really want to know what approach 

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,793
you're going to take to this course. 
So we're asking you to sign a commitment 

57
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:26,228
contract. 
That means, some of you will choose to be 

58
00:03:26,228 --> 00:03:29,970
more passive sponges. 
You're going to watch the lectures and 

59
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,352
not much else. 
Some of you will be fully engaged in the 

60
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:35,485
course. 
You're going to complete all the 

61
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:39,410
assignments, watch the lectures, 
participate in the discussion boards. 

62
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,122
There is not a right or a wrong choice, 
but we'd really like to know what 

63
00:03:43,122 --> 00:03:47,192
approach you're going to take. 
So, please go to the About the Course 

64
00:03:47,192 --> 00:03:52,226
section and look at the timeline. 
There, you'll have the opportunity to 

65
00:03:52,226 --> 00:03:55,930
make a commitment contract to one of the 
categories. 

66
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,210
One way we'd like to help you manage your 
time is by posting an online calendar. 

67
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:05,235
This calendar has all of the assignments 
and deadlines you need to complete this 

68
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,199
course. 
It's also something that you can easily 

69
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:12,770
upload to your own online calendar in 
whatever format works best for you. 

70
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,711
You'll notice that all the assignments 
are due at 11:59 p.m., EST, that's 

71
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:22,610
Eastern Standard Time. 
We're at lovely Durham, North Carolina 

72
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:27,870
and real cities like Washington DC and 
New York City are located. 

73
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,242
You'll have a full week to get to know 
the material before the quizzes due. 

74
00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:39,38
But, since this is about procrastination, 
you might want to finish those quizzes a 

75
00:04:39,38 --> 00:04:40,488
little bit earlier. 

76
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,599
 >> The last thing we want to talk to you 
about is how to spend your time wisely so 

77
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,946
that you get the most out of this course? 
One way to do this is thorough testing. 

78
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:52,569
Now, testing has pretty bad reputation, 
especially in some circles, but when it's 

79
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:55,730
done, right it can really help you retain 
information. 

80
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,636
So if you take the passive sponge 
approach that Susan described to you, you 

81
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:03,983
might feel like you're getting all of the 
information, that you're understanding 

82
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:06,561
everything. 
But, until you put yourself into a 

83
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:11,169
slightly vulnerable position, you might 
not realize that you haven't picked up as 

84
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,554
much of it as you thought. 
What the research suggests on this and we 

85
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:18,194
supplied you with an article in the 
Pre-course Recommended Reading, is that, 

86
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,666
when we're passively absorbing 
information and everything seems to make 

87
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,474
sense, we're not aware of those gaps in 
our understanding that really only reveal 

88
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,248
themselves once we try to retrieve that 
information. 

89
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:33,84
So our brains go uh-oh, I guess I didn't 
really understand that, as well as I 

90
00:05:33,84 --> 00:05:36,582
thought I did, and we try to fill in that 
information. 

91
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:40,252
And, once we try to fill in those gaps, 
we start to learn more. 

92
00:05:40,252 --> 00:05:44,770
So, it turns out that highlighting is 
mostly a waste of time. 

93
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,720
I can't get sued by the highlighter 
companies for that, can I? 

94
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,816
Unless you just want to add some color to 
an otherwise drab piece of paper, it's 

95
00:05:51,816 --> 00:05:53,248
not going to get you very far. 

96
00:05:53,248 --> 00:06:04,394
 >> We know you want to learn, so test 
yourself. 

97
00:06:04,394 --> 00:06:07,31
[MUSIC].
