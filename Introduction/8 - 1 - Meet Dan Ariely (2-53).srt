00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:03,927
Hi, my name's Don Ariely.
I'm the James B Duke, Professor of

2
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:07,709
Psychology and Behavioral Economics at
Duke University.

3
00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:11,138
I hope you're as impressed with the title
as my mother.

4
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:16,009
You might be wondering why somebody with
my accent, which is an Israeli accent, is

5
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:20,066
wearing an Indian shirt.
I'll tell you my philosophy about dress.

6
00:00:20,066 --> 00:00:23,409
I think that people dress in a very, very
uncomfortable way.

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,017
I hate suits, I hate ties.
And every time I come to speak, people

8
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:30,528
expect some formal wear, which is
incredibly uncomfortable.

9
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,032
So I figure that if I wear some clothing
from a different culture, nobody who is

10
00:00:35,032 --> 00:00:39,792
politically correct, and almost everybody
I meet is politically correct, can ever

11
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,764
say something.
So I be, I can be both comfortable, both

12
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:46,471
comfortable and nobody would be upset with
me, and that's my strategy.

13
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:51,192
Throughout this term, semester, few weeks
that we're going to hang out together

14
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:56,117
we're going to cover all kinds of topics.
We're going to think about irrationality

15
00:00:56,117 --> 00:00:59,766
in a general sense, like as an
introduction to irrationality.

16
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:03,993
As if any of you need understanding of
irrationality, but we'll go into some

17
00:01:03,993 --> 00:01:08,616
depth into exactly what irrationality is,
what are some of the more common ones and

18
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:12,589
how do we try to overcome them.
We'll talk about the psychology of money.

19
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:16,438
Money's everywhere around us,
nevertheless, when you think about it, we

20
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:20,440
don't truly understand how money works.
And in this lecture, we will try to

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,856
understand the psychological effects of
money and how different ways of thinking

22
00:01:24,856 --> 00:01:28,712
about money, getting us to think
differently and spend differently.

23
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:33,960
We'll also talk about dishonesty.
We'll talk about what we think dishonesty

24
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,901
is driven by, and what it's actually
driven by, and what can we do to try and

25
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:43,074
decrease dishonesty.
We'll also talk about motivation and

26
00:01:43,074 --> 00:01:48,105
labor, what gets people to care and not
care what are all the things.

27
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:51,874
That gets people to care, and what is the
role of money in this caring.

28
00:01:51,874 --> 00:01:56,022
How bonuses work and how small amounts of
money work to change people's behaviors

29
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:58,849
and motivations.
We'll also talk about self-control.

30
00:01:58,849 --> 00:02:02,223
Self-control is this idea that we want to
behave in a certain way.

31
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:06,321
In the long term, we have all kinds of
wishes and aspirations for ourselves, but

32
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:08,971
when the time comes, we often fail for
temptation.

33
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:12,959
Why does it happen?
How can we deal with it?

34
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,263
And finally, we'll talk about emotions.
We have to admit that we are emotional

35
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,950
creatures.
Emotion is the base of our brain, it

36
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,902
controls much of our behaviors.
Nevertheless we don't give it enough

37
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:27,371
credit very frequently.
And in this lecture we will try to

38
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:32,364
understand how emotions work on us.
When they get the best of us, and when we

39
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:36,683
would be better without them.
And that's basically what we're going to

40
00:02:36,683 --> 00:02:40,046
do in this class.
We're going to try and figure out what is

41
00:02:40,046 --> 00:02:44,665
driving those strange behaviors.
How common they are, where they come from,

42
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,131
what causes them.
And also, how to control them and how to

43
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:52,897
try to eliminate them.
I hope you'll join me, and I think it will

44
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:53,493
be fun.
