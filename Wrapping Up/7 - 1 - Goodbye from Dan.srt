1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:04,422
Thank you very much for persevering
throughout this course and hanging out

2
00:00:04,422 --> 00:00:06,536
with us.
I hope you found it useful.

3
00:00:06,536 --> 00:00:11,302
If you think about the overarching theme
across all of the topics we covered, it's

4
00:00:11,302 --> 00:00:15,501
all about experimentations.
It's all about the fact that many times we

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:18,496
believe that we have an intuition that is
correct.

6
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:23,472
We believe that we know what's driving our
behavior, and we know what's driving other

7
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:27,166
people's behaviors, but often this
intuition is not correct.

8
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:30,816
It's not accurate.
And what we do in the experimental method

9
00:00:30,816 --> 00:00:33,896
is we put these challenges to the
experimental method.

10
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:36,922
We say, let's see.
Let's compare this condition and the

11
00:00:36,922 --> 00:00:39,973
control condition.
Let's see if what we think will work

12
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:44,030
better is actually works better.
And I think this is something we need to

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,869
incorporate in our daily lives to a higher
degree.

14
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:51,029
I think much like the FDA, the Feder the
Food and Drug Administration, forces

15
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:55,459
physicians to test their intuitions about
what medications will work and not work.

16
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:58,325
I think we need similar things in the
business world, in the policy world and in

17
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:00,715
our personal world, right?
We make lots and lots of decisions.

18
00:01:00,715 --> 00:01:06,041
Are those the right decisions?
Is following your intuitions really

19
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,582
correct, okay?
And I think that if we took this

20
00:01:08,582 --> 00:01:13,838
experimental approach and said that before
we make any important decision, we want to

21
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,218
try things out, we want to figure out
empirically and not just with other

22
00:01:18,218 --> 00:01:22,631
intuitions, I thinks, I think that we will
make much better decisions.

23
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:27,352
And finally, I want to say that behavioral
economics, and social science more

24
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:30,298
generally, is an incredibly applicable
field.

25
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:34,744
Every principle we learn, every principle
we discover, can have lots of

26
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:38,350
manifestations in all kinds of areas of
decision making.

27
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,042
People get overburdened with choice.
It has implications for how people choose

28
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,846
online and offline, what we do with health
care, what we do with insurance.

29
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:50,817
If we think about the roles of emotion, it
has to do with how do we give to charity

30
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:54,076
and how we think about the kids and what
do we do with education.

31
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:58,291
When we think about bonuses and salaries,
it has to do with the education system and

32
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,549
Wall Street.
When we think about dishonesty, it has to

33
00:02:01,549 --> 00:02:05,916
do with crime and Wall Street again.
It also has to do with judges and the

34
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:09,325
legal system and so on.
And I think that the real benefit for

35
00:02:09,325 --> 00:02:13,361
studying social science comes from trying
to apply those principles.

36
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:21,053
So if I can leave you with this one wish,
it's to try and take those ideas and as

37
00:02:21,053 --> 00:02:27,963
you go forward in life try to think about
where you could apply them.

38
00:02:27,963 --> 00:02:36,608
Try to take any particular situation and
try to analyze what are the potential

39
00:02:36,608 --> 00:02:44,673
forces, what are the potential.
And I think that if we all do it we could

40
00:02:44,673 --> 00:02:53,313
do much better.
And I think that if we all do it we could

41
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:56,189
do much better.
