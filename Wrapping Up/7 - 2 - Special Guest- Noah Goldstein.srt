1
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,377
Hi, I'm Noah Goldstein, a faculty member 
at the UCLA Anderson School of 

2
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:12,400
Management. 
And today, I'll be talking with you about 

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,599
persuasion, specifically one principle of 
persuasion, so let's get started. 

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,376
So, Tony Little is a fitness guru who has 
sold dozens of exercise contraptions, 

5
00:00:21,376 --> 00:00:25,408
doohickeys, and gizmos that you may have 
seen on late night infomercials and other 

6
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:29,884
television commericals. 
Now, Tony Little has been widely 

7
00:00:29,884 --> 00:00:33,212
successful selling all of these different 
contraptions using the standard 

8
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:36,970
infomercial lines that we're all quite 
familiar with. 

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,662
But after hiring a infomercial consultant 
named [UNKNOWN] sales of his latest 

10
00:00:41,662 --> 00:00:46,335
contraption skyrocketed. 
Now, what's particularly remarkable about 

11
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:49,965
this huge increase in sales is that it's 
been largely attributed to a seemingly 

12
00:00:49,965 --> 00:00:53,595
small change that Colleen Szot made to an 
infomercial line that we're all quite 

13
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:58,762
familiar with. 
And that line is, operators are standing 

14
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:03,0
by, please call now and we've all heard 
this line a million times. 

15
00:01:03,0 --> 00:01:07,26
But Colleen Szot realized that there was 
a potentially missed opportunity for 

16
00:01:07,26 --> 00:01:10,902
persuasion. 
So she changed the line from operators 

17
00:01:10,902 --> 00:01:17,910
are standing by, please call now to, if 
operators are busy, please call again. 

18
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:21,938
If operators are busy, please call again. 
Now, if you think about it from a 

19
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:25,388
business standpoint, this seems suicidal, 
after all, it's hard enough to get this 

20
00:01:25,388 --> 00:01:28,924
guy, interested in exercising in the 
first place. 

21
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:32,60
But, now you're seemingly conveying to 
him, by saying if operators are busy, 

22
00:01:32,60 --> 00:01:35,245
please call again, that if he bothers to 
take his finger out of his mouth, and he 

23
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:38,381
used it to dial the number he sees on the 
screen, he's going to encounter a busy 

24
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:43,450
signal. 
But there's a certain genius to this 

25
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,968
change that Calisat made. 
Think about the type of mental imagery 

26
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:50,80
that comes to mind with these two 
different lines. 

27
00:01:50,80 --> 00:01:54,520
Operators are standing by. 
What are you imagining in your mind? 

28
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,808
You imagine a couple of bored looking 
sales representatives maybe twitting 

29
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:02,74
their thumbs. 
Or maybe dozing off, or doing their 

30
00:02:02,74 --> 00:02:06,670
crossword puzzle, which is clearly 
indicative of low sales and poor demand. 

31
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,960
On the other hand, if operators are busy, 
please call again. 

32
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,990
That's a very different mental image that 
comes to mind. 

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,400
You can imagine scores of people 
answering the phones you know? 

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,150
Which is clearly indicative of 
popularity, right? 

35
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:43,411
High sales and and large demand. 
Today's mini lecture will be on a that 

36
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:47,305
people look to others to guide their own 
behavior, especially when they're 

37
00:02:47,305 --> 00:02:52,225
uncertain how to behave. 
Now before we really get into the studies 

38
00:02:52,225 --> 00:02:56,237
that I'll be talking about, I just wanted 
to briefly introduce the domain in which 

39
00:02:56,237 --> 00:03:00,880
we conducted our studies and that's hotel 
towels. 

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,520
So if you've stayed at a hotel recently, 
you've seen that there are these signs 

41
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,467
that ask you to reuse your towels in 
order to help save the environment. 

42
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:13,559
And why do you think that these things 
have become so popular in hotels? 

43
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:17,321
Now fortunately, it's that hotels are 
really caring about the environment and 

44
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:21,136
they really want to help. 
Okay, now this is a cynacism check 

45
00:03:21,136 --> 00:03:25,74
because at home you're probably thinking, 
we'll wait a minute. 

46
00:03:25,74 --> 00:03:28,714
I'm sure the hotels want to help save the 
environment, but there has to be another 

47
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,845
reason why. 
It turns out that the hotels can save a 

48
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:35,827
lot of money if people decide to reuse 
their towels and bed linens. 

49
00:03:35,827 --> 00:03:39,832
Okay, so it helps the environment but of 
course it also helps the hotel. 

50
00:03:39,832 --> 00:03:43,726
Now, my colleagues and I were quite 
curious about whether or not these signs 

51
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:48,361
are actually effective at getting people 
to reuse their towels. 

52
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:52,196
And so we looked around and we found a 
study that suggested that these signs 

53
00:03:52,196 --> 00:03:56,812
work surprisingly well. 
So one little study we saw suggested that 

54
00:03:56,812 --> 00:04:00,592
over three quarters of people, who are 
given the opportunity to reuse their 

55
00:04:00,592 --> 00:04:04,914
towel, do so at least sometime during 
their stay. 

56
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:08,808
It doesn't mean that 75% of people do it 
all the time, but at least participating 

57
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:12,406
in the program in some way, shape, or 
form. 

58
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:16,306
So what we wanted to see was what if we 
communicated this social proof 

59
00:04:16,306 --> 00:04:22,190
information to, other hotel guests? 
Would we see an additional boost in towel 

60
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,274
reuse? 
So we were fortunate enough to solicit 

61
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:29,432
the cooperation of a local Holiday Inn 
manager, who allowed us to go into the 

62
00:04:29,432 --> 00:04:33,266
hotel. 
And replace their signs with our signs 

63
00:04:33,266 --> 00:04:37,486
and I'd like to tell you about three of 
those different signs. 

64
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:41,206
The first one was a standard 
environmental message, that one just told 

65
00:04:41,206 --> 00:04:46,272
guests that what they were doing was 
going to help save the environment. 

66
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:50,559
So the environment deserves our respect. 
You can show your respect for nature and 

67
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,617
help save the environment by reusing your 
towels during your stay. 

68
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:58,235
This is a very typical message what you 
typically see at hotels all around the 

69
00:04:58,235 --> 00:05:01,200
world. 
The next one is based on this principal 

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,494
of social proof and it says, join your 
fellow guests in helping to save the 

71
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:08,154
environment. 
In a study conducted in Fall 2003, that 

72
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:12,3
was several years prior to when we 
actually conducted our study. 

73
00:05:12,3 --> 00:05:15,766
75% of the guests participated in our new 
resource savings program by using their 

74
00:05:15,766 --> 00:05:19,412
towels more than once. 
You can join your fellow guests in this 

75
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:24,22
program to help save the environment by 
reusing your towels during your stay. 

76
00:05:24,22 --> 00:05:27,841
So, as you can see, this is the principle 
social proof, the idea that lots of other 

77
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:32,700
people are reusing their towels. 
And so we think that that may influence a 

78
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:36,581
guest's behavior, so let's actually take 
a look at the data. 

79
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:40,475
And what you're seeing here is a graph of 
the change in towel reuse rate compared 

80
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:44,605
to the standard environmental appeal rate 
and what we found is simply by indicating 

81
00:05:44,605 --> 00:05:50,181
that these majority of other people were 
reusing their towels. 

82
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:53,158
We saw a 20% increase in towel reuse, 
right? 

83
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:56,940
Now, if you think about it, this 
principle of social proof seems obvious, 

84
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,204
right? 
Everyone follows the herd, it seems like 

85
00:06:00,204 --> 00:06:04,44
we all kind of know this intuitively and 
yet, if it's so obvious, why isn't the 

86
00:06:04,44 --> 00:06:08,292
hotel doing it? 
Why have we never seen a single hotel 

87
00:06:08,292 --> 00:06:12,395
ever actually communicating this 
information to the guest? 

88
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:15,929
So that's you know, one of the meta 
points of today is that, despite the fact 

89
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:20,309
that principles of persuasion seem 
obvious in hindsight. 

90
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:24,242
when people are actually trying to 
persuade, they often fail to utilize 

91
00:06:24,242 --> 00:06:29,639
these seemingly simplistic principles. 
So, whenever the desirable behavior is 

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,592
the norm, when other people are doing the 
right thing that they're taking the 

93
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:37,663
action that you want people to take, it's 
really important to remember the power of 

94
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:43,243
the principle of social proof. 
Now the thing is, even though 

95
00:06:43,243 --> 00:06:47,659
organizations and individuals often fail 
to use this principle. 

96
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:51,213
I'm not saying that nobody uses it. 
Marketers tend to be pretty good at it 

97
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:54,184
and we're certainly seen some examples of 
that. 

98
00:06:54,184 --> 00:06:57,748
So, we might hear that the for F-series 
truck is the best selling truck in 

99
00:06:57,748 --> 00:07:00,800
America, right? 
I mean, what they're doing is 

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,634
communicating the principle social proof, 
so that when somebody is uncertain about 

101
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:09,264
which type of car they're going to buy. 
If they look to the marketing slogan then 

102
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:12,248
they recognize, okay? 
Well, if that's the best selling car in 

103
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:16,5
America, most people are choosing that, 
so I should choose that too. 

104
00:07:16,5 --> 00:07:19,662
So there are of course cases that we see 
where marketers get it right. 

105
00:07:19,662 --> 00:07:23,622
But I'm going to make the argument that 
even in marketing people who know these 

106
00:07:23,622 --> 00:07:29,32
principles very well, I still think that 
there is room for improvement. 

107
00:07:29,32 --> 00:07:33,609
So, for example, if you look at any time 
a company introduces a new product. 

108
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:38,743
So for example let's say it's a, Arby's 
New Angus Three Cheese & Bacon burger. 

109
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:42,258
Now what do they tend to do when they're 
advertising this product? 

110
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:45,534
Well one thing that they do, and the 
major thing that they do is talk about 

111
00:07:45,534 --> 00:07:49,380
why it's so good. 
What are the benefits to the customer? 

112
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,693
What is the customer going to like about 
that? 

113
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:55,333
And that's very intuitive, it makes total 
sense why they would do that, but I'm 

114
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:59,950
going to argue that there is a missed 
opportunity for persuasion. 

115
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,559
Now if you think about it, how did these 
products actually come to market? 

116
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:09,359
Does the CEO just say, slap together some 
mayo, some brisket, and no that's not how 

117
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:14,997
decisions are made big decisions are made 
at these big companies. 

118
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:18,124
There's a lot of internal market 
research, or there's a lot of internal 

119
00:08:18,124 --> 00:08:21,675
testing to see whether or not an idea, a 
particular sandwich, let's say the three 

120
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:27,283
cheese bacon burger is actually something 
that customers are going to like. 

121
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:30,867
So, in order to decide whether we should 
bring that product to the market, or a 

122
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:36,2
totally different product to the market. 
They have to actually test which one is 

123
00:08:36,2 --> 00:08:40,757
better, which one consumers like, maybe 
compare it to competitors burgers. 

124
00:08:40,757 --> 00:08:44,411
And, now what's interesting about these 
internal test market data, is that 

125
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:48,181
companies use them in order to make the 
decision of which products to actually 

126
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:52,743
bring to the market. 
But, I would argue that there's a missed 

127
00:08:52,743 --> 00:08:57,124
opportunity for influence there based on 
the principal social proof. 

128
00:08:57,124 --> 00:09:00,712
in fact, not only are these data often 
internal test market data, but sometimes 

129
00:09:00,712 --> 00:09:04,144
before introducing the campaign 
nationally, they'll go out and they'll go 

130
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:09,995
to town in North Carolina, and introduce 
the burger there and see how it does. 

131
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:12,860
See how people like it, in comparison to 
other things. 

132
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,490
now the point is, here's this heard 
information that you have, you know that 

133
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,955
people prefer this burger to maybe a 
Wendy's version of that burger and yet, 

134
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:23,420
that information is used to make the 
decision of which product to take to the 

135
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,720
market, and is rarely actually 
communicated to the consumer and I would 

136
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,911
call that a failed opportunity or a 
missed opportunity for persuasion. 

137
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:37,730
Now, there are a couple of times in, in 
marketing history when companies have 

138
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,549
gotten it right, if you think about the 
Pepsi challenge for example, if Pepsi had 

139
00:09:41,549 --> 00:09:45,254
realized that if you drink a little sip 
of Pepsi or Coke in a blind taste test 

140
00:09:45,254 --> 00:09:51,247
more people, right, the herd, actually 
prefers Pepsi. 

141
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:55,87
So Pepsi went out and said, take the 
Pepsi challenge, here's what our data 

142
00:09:55,87 --> 00:09:58,151
show. 
But rarely have we actually seen this 

143
00:09:58,151 --> 00:10:02,104
implemented in marketing campaigns 
despite the seeming obviousness of the 

144
00:10:02,104 --> 00:10:05,723
principle. 
Now there are a couple of exceptions to 

145
00:10:05,723 --> 00:10:09,151
this one just to keep in the fast food 
domain. 

146
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,728
Wendy's came out with new fries. 
Now again, they didn't just say, alright 

147
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,223
well lets. 
The CEO didn't say here's how we're 

148
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:18,562
going to make the fries, there were 
ideas, there was internal market research 

149
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:22,890
and ultimately they. 
figured out that people preferred these 

150
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,902
fries to McDonalds fries in a blind taste 
test. 

151
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:29,486
And so, what Wendy's did was, they 
actually did the right thing something 

152
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:32,697
very different than what we typically 
see. 

153
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,577
They came out with a campaign saying 
that, you know? 

154
00:10:35,577 --> 00:10:39,877
Roughly 56 percent of people preferred 
their fries to McDonalds, right? 

155
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:43,288
That's what the herd is doing. 
Now, I'm not arguing that this type of 

156
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:46,704
campaign would make people who are 
McDonalds devotees that it would make 

157
00:10:46,704 --> 00:10:52,82
them run into a Wendy's to try the fries. 
And remember what I said earlier, social 

158
00:10:52,82 --> 00:10:55,778
proof, like almost all the principles of 
influence, are going to be most powerful 

159
00:10:55,778 --> 00:10:59,472
when people are uncertain of how to 
behave. 

160
00:10:59,472 --> 00:11:02,970
So what that means is again, if you love 
McDonald's fries and you've never eaten 

161
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,44
anywhere else, you're not going to be 
influenced by this social proof 

162
00:11:06,44 --> 00:11:09,986
information. 
However, if you are person who is unsure, 

163
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:13,314
you're curious, that information is 
probably going to push you over the edge 

164
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:17,252
and you are going to be more likely to 
try the fries. 

165
00:11:17,252 --> 00:11:20,437
And Wendy's believes that once you try 
the fries, you're actually going to 

166
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:24,631
prefer those fries in the future. 
So as I was saying earlier, people follow 

167
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:27,108
the herd. 
We've seen some evidence for this and of 

168
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:31,176
course, this is not the only study done 
on the principle of social proof. 

169
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:34,508
There's lots of other research that 
validates this principle, but there's an 

170
00:11:34,508 --> 00:11:38,970
important question that we have to ask. 
Which is yeah, sure people follow the 

171
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,910
herd but we have to remember, they're are 
a lot of different herds out there. 

172
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:47,139
So which herd are we going to be most 
likely to follow. 

173
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,735
So, earlier I was talking about the 
social proof message that we used in the 

174
00:11:50,735 --> 00:11:57,362
hotel. 
Which indicated that 75% of people who 

175
00:11:57,362 --> 00:12:08,282
were similar to the hotel guests, right, 
75% of people who had stayed in a hotel 

176
00:12:08,282 --> 00:12:19,760
just like our, our guests reuse their 
towels. 

177
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,182
We said the following, 75% of the guests 
who stayed in your room #321, or whatever 

178
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:28,736
the room number was, participated in the 
new resource savings program and the rest 

179
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:35,478
of the message was exactly the same. 
So, remember, all of the herd information 

180
00:12:35,478 --> 00:12:39,438
is the same, in the terms of the number 
75%, but in, in that prior case it's 

181
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:43,596
other people like you at the hotel, and 
in this case it's people who stayed in 

182
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:49,367
your room. 
Now, let's take a look at the data. 

183
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:53,583
So, earlier we found a 20% increase in 
the likelihood of reusing our towels 

184
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:57,799
simply by informing people that the 
majority of others were reusing their 

185
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:04,187
towel, like others in the hotel. 
But now what happens when we tell people, 

186
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:09,801
that other people who stayed in your 
particular room reuse their towels? 

187
00:13:09,801 --> 00:13:14,335
Now we get a 33% increase in towel reuse, 
so what's going on here? 

188
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:18,202
Want you to ask yourself, is this 
rational behavior? 

189
00:13:18,202 --> 00:13:22,289
If you think about it, there is no 
rational reason why the norms operating 

190
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:26,510
in your particular room are going to be 
any more adaptive or any more effective 

191
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:33,1
than the norms in the rooms next door. 
And in fact, if you really think about it 

192
00:13:33,1 --> 00:13:36,713
deeply there is no group of people who 
has done more to ickefy, your room, than 

193
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:40,960
the very people who've stayed in it 
previously. 

194
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,480
Alright, you don't even want to think 
what those people have done in your room 

195
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,721
previously. 
So again, there's no a neccessarily, 

196
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:51,529
there shouldn't be, from a logical point 
of view, even warm and fuzzy feelings 

197
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,582
between yourself and those people in the 
past. 

198
00:13:55,582 --> 00:13:59,173
Well, as we see in persuasion research as 
well as a lot of the research Jan has 

199
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:03,144
talked about, people don't always behave 
rationally. 

200
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:06,566
And in persuasion they don't always 
behave rationally in response to 

201
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:10,102
persuasive messages. 
Now, what we think is going on is that 

202
00:14:10,102 --> 00:14:13,798
normally it is adaptive to follow the 
norms of people who are similar to you, 

203
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:19,628
the norms of your particular environment. 
It normally makes sense that if you're in 

204
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:24,393
a multinational company, which norm 
should you follow for how to behave. 

205
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:27,687
Well, the norms of your particular 
department, the people on your floor, 

206
00:14:27,687 --> 00:14:32,620
normally following those norms is more 
diagnostic of what's the right behavior. 

207
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,806
And we think that people over learn this 
over time, right, that they are 

208
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:39,424
constantly being rewarded for following 
the norms of similar others in similar 

209
00:14:39,424 --> 00:14:43,48
situations. 
And that when they're not thinking 

210
00:14:43,48 --> 00:14:46,590
particularly deeply. 
They're going to be more likely to follow 

211
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:50,939
a norm like this which we call a 
provincial norm, right? 

212
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,629
Their particular province, their 
particular area or locale or context then 

213
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:01,0
you would expect rationally. 
So, one really common persuasion mistake 

214
00:15:01,0 --> 00:15:04,904
that I tend to see is that people, even 
when they remember the principle of 

215
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:09,637
social proof, they fail to point to the 
right herd. 

216
00:15:09,637 --> 00:15:13,667
And what I'm arguing here is that the 
right herd is the one that is similar to 

217
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:18,157
the audience, that shares the context of 
the audience. 

218
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:22,807
So, for example if there's an ad campaign 
in California or in Santa Monica to try 

219
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:26,651
to get Santa Monicans to recycle, and 
that's where I live, if I saw an ad that 

220
00:15:26,651 --> 00:15:32,912
said 95% of Californians recycle. 
I think that would be a good use of the 

221
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:36,572
principal social proof, that if 
especially if I'm uncertain, I would be 

222
00:15:36,572 --> 00:15:42,87
more likely to do it, but I don't think 
that is the optimal message. 

223
00:15:42,87 --> 00:15:45,747
Assuming of course that the norms were 
the same and 95% of people in Santa 

224
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:49,346
Monica recycled, I would be much more 
persuaded by an ad that said 95% of 

225
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:55,260
people in Santa Monica recycle. 
And so you always have to remember, you 

226
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,800
know, when I'm going to convey this herd 
information, this social proof 

227
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,107
information what is the right herd and, 
and hopefully based on this discussion I 

228
00:16:03,107 --> 00:16:09,200
pointed you in the right direction. 
I'm glad I had the chance to talk to you 

229
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,166
for at least a little bit about the 
science of persuasion. 

230
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:17,1
If you're interested in learning more, 
you can always go out and buy a book that 

231
00:16:17,1 --> 00:16:22,232
I have co-authored with Robert Cialdini 
and Steve Martin entitled, yes. 

232
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:25,886
And one final fact that I'll end on is 
that 95% of people who have watched this 

233
00:16:25,886 --> 00:16:29,614
video have gone out and bought it 
immediately. 

234
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,849
Thank you very much.
