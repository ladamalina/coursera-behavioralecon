00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:02,311
Hello. 
My name is Todd Rogers. 

2
00:00:02,311 --> 00:00:07,320
I'm a professor of Public Policy at the 
Harvard Kennedy School. 

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,675
Today, we're going to be talking about a 
specific domain, voter mobilization, and 

4
00:00:11,675 --> 00:00:16,95
how behavioral science can be applied to 
a specific problem, mobilizing voters, 

5
00:00:16,95 --> 00:00:22,226
and the kind of progress that's possible 
after years of focus on it. 

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,758
I started as a political poster and I 
realized there was a science behavior 

7
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:30,150
change that we weren't really using in 
politics. 

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,506
So, I went to grad school, learned about 
this, and then I went back to Washington 

9
00:00:34,506 --> 00:00:38,400
and started a research institute with 
others, co-founded it, where we 

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,873
translated the insights of Behavioral 
Science into political strategy. 

11
00:00:44,873 --> 00:00:49,295
We focused on things like donation, 
volunteerism resource allocation, and 

12
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:52,715
voter mobilization. 
Today, we're going to be talking of just 

13
00:00:52,715 --> 00:00:55,897
that one outcome. 
How do we maximize the impact of money 

14
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:59,850
spent on mobilizing voters? 
We're going to see the kind of progress 

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,126
that's possible as this field of 
Behavioral Science has been applied to 

16
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:09,184
this one problem. 
So, to begin, here's a picture of me 10 

17
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:13,772
years ago. 
I was volunteering for a campaign, I had 

18
00:01:13,772 --> 00:01:18,60
a lot more hair, and I was making a phone 
call that was completely consistent with 

19
00:01:18,60 --> 00:01:23,434
the norms of about a decade ago. 
I would begin the script by saying, 

20
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,360
hello, Mrs.Smith. 
It's easy to vote. 

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,980
The issues at stake are important, it's 
going to be close. 

22
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,420
So, your vote matters, and it's your 
civic responsibility to vote. 

23
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,960
Do you intend to vote? 
Now, of course, she says, like everybody, 

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,880
95% of people say this, yes, I intend to 
vote. 

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,710
So, I say, great, thanks. 
Have a nice night. 

26
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,655
So, that's the standard. 
That's the, the industry standard, the 

27
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:51,740
most common kind of message that was used 
up to about a decade ago. 

28
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,583
And if you unpack it, you can see that 
what we're really emphasizing are very 

29
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,256
rational variables. 
Things like, it's easy to vote, 

30
00:01:59,256 --> 00:02:04,45
suggesting that the cost is low. 
It's important, the race is important, so 

31
00:02:04,45 --> 00:02:09,869
if you have an impact, it's going to be 
high because the consequences are high. 

32
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,359
The, it's a close election, meaning you 
could be the pivotal voter, and it's your 

33
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:18,328
civic duty to vote. 
Now if you unpack this, each of these is 

34
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:23,710
part of the rational voter model. 
What's fascinating is, up until about 

35
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:29,510
2004, this was the most sophisticated 
kind of of voter mobilization message. 

36
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,570
And experimentalists like Don Green and 
Alan Gerber at Yale randomized controlled 

37
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,50
experiments in the field testing 
different elements of these to get out 

38
00:02:37,50 --> 00:02:41,402
the vote scripts. 
They learned that emphasizing that it's 

39
00:02:41,402 --> 00:02:44,735
easy has no impact of a voter 
mobilization message. 

40
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:48,540
Emphasizing that it's an important 
election, similarly, no effect. 

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,906
Emphasizing that you could be the pivotal 
voter, that it's a close election, no 

42
00:02:51,906 --> 00:02:55,785
effect. 
Emphasizing that it's your civic duty, no 

43
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:58,252
effect. 
So, what they concluded in this 

44
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:01,788
meta-analysis of many of these studies is 
that the content of what you say doesn't 

45
00:03:01,788 --> 00:03:06,446
matter, so much as the mode of contact. 
And what they found at the time was that 

46
00:03:06,446 --> 00:03:12,602
the more personal, the more effective. 
Canvasing door-to-door is more effective 

47
00:03:12,602 --> 00:03:18,10
than impersonal robocall and things like 
that. 

48
00:03:18,10 --> 00:03:20,908
So, this was the, the work of behavioral 
scientists and psychologists like myself 

49
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:23,638
and, in fact, Alan Gerber and Don Green 
also moved into this direction where we 

50
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:26,326
start testing psychological elements, 
behavioral elements, that could be 

51
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:31,309
included into the, these scripts. 
We'll start with the project that I 

52
00:03:31,309 --> 00:03:36,480
conducted with a collaborator named David 
Nickerson at Notre Dame. 

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,130
So, what we have is the state of 
Pennsylvania in the 2008 primary 

54
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:41,920
election. 
So, this is[UNKNOWN] Presidential 

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,715
election, Barack Obama versus Hillary 
Clinton, the presidential primary for the 

56
00:03:45,715 --> 00:03:49,235
democratic party has not been resolved 
yet with a bunch of potential voters, 

57
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:53,926
about 300,000 of them. 
What we do is we randomly assign them to 

58
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:57,944
one of four different conditions. 
The first condition gets no contact at 

59
00:03:57,944 --> 00:03:59,400
all. 
No phone call. 

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,95
They're the untreated control group. 
The second condition gets a standard 

61
00:04:03,95 --> 00:04:06,313
voter mobilization script. 
It's important, please vote. 

62
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:11,278
You could be a pivotal voter. 
The next group gets the standard, plus do 

63
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:14,920
you intend to vote. 
Just eliciting a commitment or an 

64
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,326
intention. 
And now, the fourth gets the standard, 

65
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:23,396
plus the intention, plus a battery of 
questions designed to elicit a concrete 

66
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,791
plan. 
Do you intend to vote? 

67
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,340
Yes. 
What time will you vote? 

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,320
How will you get there? 
Where will you be coming from? 

69
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,810
This is a very concrete set of questions. 
Now, this is inspired by research in 

70
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,900
Cognitive Psychology, on implementation 
intentions. 

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,596
People like Peter Gollwitzer at NYU and 
others have worked on this for decades, 

72
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:46,124
and they found that as you unpack the 
concrete details of an act, it makes you 

73
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:50,762
more likely to follow through on it for 
two reasons. 

74
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:54,920
One, you're more likely to schedule it, 
it's pure mechanical scheduling. 

75
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,696
But the second more sophisticated 
interesting psychological piece is that 

76
00:04:58,696 --> 00:05:02,708
when you unpack the concrete details, you 
say, oh, on Tuesday, I'm going to drop my 

77
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:07,140
kids off at school and then I'm going to 
go vote. 

78
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,788
That when you, when that time arrives, 
and you're driving home from dropping 

79
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:14,209
your kids off at school, it pops in your 
mind. 

80
00:05:14,209 --> 00:05:17,800
It's just more likely because you've 
created the association between that 

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,570
context and the planned intention. 
So, what we're going to do here is study 

82
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,740
what's the impact of adding that to voter 
mobilization call. 

83
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Whether you vote or not is public 
records, so this is the outcome measure 

84
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,36
we're going to be using. 
Many people don't realize that whether 

85
00:05:34,36 --> 00:05:36,740
you vote, or whether you show up or not, 
is public. 

86
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:42,104
Who you vote for, not public at all, 1892 
Federal Law, secret ballot. 

87
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:46,821
But whether you vote is public. 
So, we find when we graph here the impact 

88
00:05:46,821 --> 00:05:50,526
of these calls versus no call, we find 
that the people who receive the standard 

89
00:05:50,526 --> 00:05:54,835
call, please vote, it's important, it's 
important. 

90
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:59,302
No, no effect. 
Just like dozens of other experiments, 

91
00:05:59,302 --> 00:06:03,718
reminding people of an election is, has 
no meaningful effect even though millions 

92
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:08,676
of dollars are spent on it. 
Asking them, do they intend to vote, 

93
00:06:08,676 --> 00:06:14,550
eliciting a self-prediction, and this is 
the most sophisticated call as of 2008. 

94
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,460
Asking them to elicit a self-prediction, 
do you intend to vote. 

95
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,530
Everybody says, yes. 
Has a small effect, a two percentage 

96
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:24,650
point effect. 
It's a real effect. 

97
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,650
and other studies have sort of, are 
consistent with this. 

98
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,270
It's in effect but it's about 2 
percentage points. 

99
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,534
This is in line with other kinds of 
studies on voter mobilization phone calls 

100
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:38,100
without anything psychologically 
sophisticated in them. 

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,289
It might even be a little bit smaller 
than that than those studies might 

102
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,8
suggest. 
But adding the plan making battery, more 

103
00:06:46,8 --> 00:06:49,852
than doubles the impact of what was at 
the time the most effective get out to 

104
00:06:49,852 --> 00:06:53,962
vote call. 
So, adding a plan making battery, this 

105
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:57,683
very small marginal cost addition can 
more then double the get out to vote 

106
00:06:57,683 --> 00:07:01,15
phone call. 
So, when I was talking about woman I 

107
00:07:01,15 --> 00:07:05,2
should have added, Mrs. 
Smith, please remember what time will you 

108
00:07:05,2 --> 00:07:09,510
vote, how will you get there, where will 
you be coming from? 

109
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:14,225
That's one like of research that 
collaborators and I have worked on. 

110
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:19,43
Another looks at how do we emphasize, how 
should we emphasize the way turnout is 

111
00:07:19,43 --> 00:07:22,730
going to be? 
Should we emphasize that not enough 

112
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,560
people are voting? 
You hear this a lot, not enough young 

113
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,120
people are voting, not enough low income 
people are voting, etc. 

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,305
Or should we have them say, lots of other 
people joining, voting so please join 

115
00:07:32,305 --> 00:07:35,280
them. 
We, in 2004, I surveyed self-reported 

116
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,540
experts and voter mobilization, basically 
political consultants who work on voter 

117
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,507
mobilizations. 
And they were roughly split, 50/50, and 

118
00:07:43,507 --> 00:07:48,586
which is more effective, emphasizing high 
turnout or emphasizing low turnout? 

119
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:52,734
Now, what we find across several 
experiments, this is with Alan Gerber at 

120
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:57,494
Yale, is that emphasizing high turnout is 
much more effective in motivating people 

121
00:07:57,494 --> 00:08:02,800
to participate[COUGH] than emphasizing 
low turnout. 

122
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,950
We've, we've seen this with self-reported 
intention to vote. 

123
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,878
We've seen this with click through and 
e-mail and across a lot of other 

124
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:10,626
behaviors. 
We see that, that people conform to the 

125
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:14,308
behavior of others. 
And I imagine that that some of you are 

126
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:17,866
familiar with that. 
So, when I was talking to Mrs. 

127
00:08:17,866 --> 00:08:21,226
Smith, I should have also said in 
addition to what time will you vote, how 

128
00:08:21,226 --> 00:08:24,810
will you get there, where will you be 
coming from, I should have said, join the 

129
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,19
millions of others who are going to be 
voting. 

130
00:08:29,19 --> 00:08:32,205
Turn outs are going to be high so please 
join the others, emphasizing high 

131
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,763
turnout. 
Even though ironically, more people 

132
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,463
voting decreases the likelihood that 
you're going to be pivotal but the 

133
00:08:37,463 --> 00:08:41,300
likelihood that you're going to pivotal 
is 1 in 10 million anyway. 

134
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,225
The likelihood that it's going to be a 
tie and your vote is going to be the 

135
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:45,395
difference is less than the likelihood 
that you're going to get hit by a car on 

136
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:49,728
your way to the polling place. 
So, a third line of research explores the 

137
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:54,6
question of how do we deal with how, how 
should we emphasize, how should we refer 

138
00:08:54,6 --> 00:08:58,206
to people? 
Should we refer to them as voters or as 

139
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:03,35
the kinds of people who can vote? 
And so, the underlying principle here is 

140
00:09:03,35 --> 00:09:07,966
that people have multiple identities. 
I'm a father, I'm a Philadelphia Eagles 

141
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,572
fan. 
And when you elicit one identity, I'm 

142
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:14,415
more likely to behave in certain ways 
that are consistent with it than when I 

143
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:19,317
elicit another identity. 
So, in this case, with Carol Dweck at 

144
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:23,541
Stanford and Greg Walton at Stanford and 
Chris Bryan who is the lead author on 

145
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:27,237
this at UCSD, we did a series of 
experiments where we asked people to 

146
00:09:27,237 --> 00:09:31,527
complete a survey, in which all that we 
varied was whether we, we said to vote or 

147
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:38,326
to be a voter. 
So, basically a verb or a noun. 

148
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:41,178
So, for example, we say, how important is 
it to you to vote in the tomorrow's 

149
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,216
election? 
In another condition, we say, how 

150
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:48,669
important is it to you to be a voter in 
tomorrow's election? 

151
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,928
So, what we find is that emphasizing the 
voter identity is remarkably powerful in 

152
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:58,230
making people more likely to conform to 
that behavior. 

153
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,317
And we see this across a series of 
studies both in this now in verb format, 

154
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:04,355
we also see it in other studies where 
it's, where we say as the kind of person 

155
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:10,892
who votes versus as someone who can vote. 
So, when I was talking to Mrs. 

156
00:10:10,892 --> 00:10:14,552
Smith, I should have also said, as the 
kind of person who votes, please be a 

157
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:18,512
voter in the upcoming election, please be 
a voter, in addition to make a plan and 

158
00:10:18,512 --> 00:10:23,872
join lots of others. 
And now, in very recent research, that we 

159
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:27,282
are just now be in the process to 
publishing and this is inspired by 

160
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:31,560
fascinating research, that I encourage 
you all to look into by Alan Gerber, Don 

161
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,222
Green, and Christian Larimer. 
that research showed that sending people 

162
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:42,574
their vote histories and their neighbors' 
vote histories and also sending their 

163
00:10:42,574 --> 00:10:46,798
neighbors all that information, creating 
this sort of social pressure so that 

164
00:10:46,798 --> 00:10:52,767
everyone knows who voted and who didn't. 
And then committing to after the 

165
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:55,929
election, we're going to send an update 
so everyone knows who voted and who 

166
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,760
didn't. 
Though it's incredibly creepy and elicits 

167
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,725
backlash and that people are very upset 
about it, incredibly powerful at 

168
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:08,104
increasing turnout. 
So, what we're trying to do in this next 

169
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:12,48
study is really tease apart, what is the 
impact of inducing accountability, the, 

170
00:11:12,48 --> 00:11:15,528
the, the sense that you are going to have 
to talk with someone, and have to 

171
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:20,459
potentially justify whether you voted or 
not. 

172
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,294
And so, we have this most sophisticated 
psychological mailer which you can see on 

173
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:28,160
the screen. 
And it, and it basically uses all the 

174
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,170
principles. 
It has a pop-out box for make a plan. 

175
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,870
It emphasizes repeatedly as the kind of 
person who votes, as a voter. 

176
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,200
It emphasizes high turnout, all the sort, 
all the best practices. 

177
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,555
and what it also does for half the 
people, and there about 650,000 people in 

178
00:11:45,555 --> 00:11:50,668
this experiment, for half of them, we 
send them this letter. 

179
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,574
And for the other half, and this in the 
2010 general election, and the other 

180
00:11:54,574 --> 00:11:58,858
half, we add them in the top right corner 
you may be called after the election to 

181
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:05,130
discuss your voting experience. 
Basically, this, this threat that you may 

182
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:09,418
be called, so it's supposed to create the 
sense that maybe you may have to explain 

183
00:12:09,418 --> 00:12:15,302
to someone whether you voted or not. 
And we add a paragraph in which we also 

184
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:18,563
described that. 
So, what we find is that adding just this 

185
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:22,31
little call out box and a paragraph 
reiterating, basically saying we may call 

186
00:12:22,31 --> 00:12:25,550
you after the election, look out for our 
call, increased the effectiveness of that 

187
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,23
mailer by more than 40%. 
So, we already have the most 

188
00:12:30,23 --> 00:12:33,270
psychologically sophisticated mailer that 
we can develop. 

189
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,910
It uses all these best practices that 
we've learned from dozens or hundreds of 

190
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,823
experiments. 
And then we add, just add in the 

191
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:43,463
top-right corner, we may call you after 
the election, and we reiterated in the 

192
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:48,180
text, and that increases the 
effectiveness by more than 40%. 

193
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,342
So, let's pull it all together. 
So, when I was talking to Mrs. 

194
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:53,181
Smith, I should have said, what time will 
you vote? 

195
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:55,730
How will you get there? 
Where are you coming from? 

196
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,570
And also, lots of others will vote, you 
should join them. 

197
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,790
And also, you're the kind of person who 
votes. 

198
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:04,806
Thanks for being a voter. 
And also, this last bit about adding the 

199
00:13:04,806 --> 00:13:09,84
prospect of accountability we may call 
you after the election, look out for our 

200
00:13:09,84 --> 00:13:14,860
call. 
So, what we see now, in the 2012 

201
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,66
election, this research was widely used. 
We, we think, in total, this probably 

202
00:13:20,66 --> 00:13:24,440
doubles or triples the impact per dollar 
spent on voter mobilization. 

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,806
So, there are tens of millions of dollars 
during the 2012 election spent on this 

204
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:30,684
activity. 
And what we're doing here is we're, 

205
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,39
we're, I'm now capturing as much of it as 
I can and I want to see and I'm going to 

206
00:13:34,39 --> 00:13:38,999
show you, how some of it was used. 
So, here's a mailer that I actually 

207
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:41,990
received, saying, this is the voter 
report card. 

208
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:45,457
You were a voter in the past, please 
continue to be a voter. 

209
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:49,40
Be a voter this Tuesday, and it compares 
my turnout to others. 

210
00:13:49,40 --> 00:13:52,680
So, it basically says, lots of others are 
voting, you should join them. 

211
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,337
Even though your past vote history, which 
we're now looking at appears that you 

212
00:13:56,337 --> 00:14:00,624
have voted less than others. 
This, just so everyone knows, this is an 

213
00:14:00,624 --> 00:14:04,162
artifact of having moved and the, the 
registrar had not updated my voting 

214
00:14:04,162 --> 00:14:07,874
record. 
There's no way my neighbors have voted 

215
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:10,463
more than me. 
just want to be clear, this is data 

216
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,634
error. 
Nonetheless, it's fascinating that I 

217
00:14:12,634 --> 00:14:15,832
received this treatment. 
That I've, that I've learned that has 

218
00:14:15,832 --> 00:14:19,660
been mailed to literally millions of 
people in the 2012 election, this mailer, 

219
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,640
which emphasizes, be a voter, join lots 
of others who are voting. 

220
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,174
This is an e-mail from a national 
security organization called the Truman 

221
00:14:28,174 --> 00:14:32,702
National Security Project. 
And if you unpack the messaging in it, it 

222
00:14:32,702 --> 00:14:38,89
says, lots of others are voting. 
Make sure you know where your, where your 

223
00:14:38,89 --> 00:14:41,996
voting place is, so it emphasizes, make a 
plan. 

224
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:47,108
it emphasizes you're the kind of person 
who votes and, so it emphasizes all three 

225
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:51,196
of those. 
It's a, it's a really sophisticated, and 

226
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:55,244
even the subject line is do you have a 
voting plan? 

227
00:14:55,244 --> 00:15:00,290
So now, on the weekend before the 
election, a woman came knocking on my 

228
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,730
door volunteering for the Elizabeth 
Warren campaign. 

229
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,790
And you can see her thumb in this image 
here, she came, she read me a script. 

230
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,180
It was fascinating and it reflected all 
of this research. 

231
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,744
She's talking to me, asking me to make a 
plan, saying, lots of others are going to 

232
00:15:17,744 --> 00:15:21,870
vote, calling me a voter and the kind of 
person who votes. 

233
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,90
It was great, so afterwards, of course, I 
said, yes and I do have a plan. 

234
00:15:25,90 --> 00:15:26,946
I know when I'm going to vote, I know 
where I'm going to be coming from, I know 

235
00:15:26,946 --> 00:15:30,604
how I'm going to get there, thank you. 
And would you mind if I took a picture of 

236
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:34,340
your script and of your finger and your 
hand while you're doing it? 

237
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,877
So, all I got was the tip of her finger, 
but this is a picture of the actual 

238
00:15:36,877 --> 00:15:40,420
script that they were using for the 
Elizabeth Warren campaign. 

239
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,210
She won in the 2012 Senate race in 
Massachusetts against Scott Brown. 

240
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:49,864
Now, here's an e-mail that was sent 
several weeks before the election by the 

241
00:15:49,864 --> 00:15:55,29
Obama campaign to their e-mail list, in 
which they said, make a plan. 

242
00:15:55,29 --> 00:15:57,440
And then they said, what time will you 
vote? 

243
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,444
How will you get here? 
Where will you be coming from? 

244
00:15:59,444 --> 00:16:01,774
These are the specific questions we used 
in our search. 

245
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:04,980
So, this is fantastic. 
And I presume that what they were going 

246
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,262
to do was e-mail back to me right before 
the election day. 

247
00:16:09,262 --> 00:16:13,438
Continuing with the Obama campaign, so 
this is the the week the night before the 

248
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:18,620
election, it says, do you have a plan for 
tomorrow, is the subject line. 

249
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,118
And as you read through it, you can see 
all the best practices we've been talking 

250
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:25,414
about. 
Now finally, this, I really want to focus 

251
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:28,470
in on. 
this is the script from the Obama 

252
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,690
campaign's calling tool. 
So, they had millions of calls made by 

253
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:36,370
volunteers. 
Delivered the, the, the week before the 

254
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:41,260
election, mobilizing other targets that 
the campaign had. 

255
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:45,408
So, if you read this script, I, I called 
in, I logged in and made some phone calls 

256
00:16:45,408 --> 00:16:49,680
and I, and I, and I took a picture of the 
script. 

257
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,710
This is the exact script they use, and as 
you unpack it, you can see each of these 

258
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:57,198
things. 
It says, I'm calling because records 

259
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,220
showed that you voted in 2008. 
we're reminding voters like you. 

260
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,874
If you keep reading it, it says we've 
talked to a lot of people in your town 

261
00:17:04,874 --> 00:17:09,229
today who are planning to vote. 
This election is going to be close and we 

262
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,730
really need your vote. 
But they talked to a lot of people who 

263
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,478
are going to vote. 
I have your polling place listed as this, 

264
00:17:15,478 --> 00:17:20,479
and that the hours are this. 
I know everyone is busy, so what time you 

265
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:24,180
plan to vote? 
Next question, will you be heading there 

266
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:29,10
from work or somewhere else? 
Basically, this is, let's elicit a plan. 

267
00:17:29,10 --> 00:17:30,700
And then, and then finally, do you need a 
ride? 

268
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,296
The, the goal of that question, of 
course, they're, they're, they're 

269
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:38,264
ingratiating themselves, offering, we'll 
give you a ride, but they're also 

270
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:44,604
prompting the target to make a plan. 
So, contrast that script with the Romney 

271
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:47,460
script. 
So, I, I made calls, I signed, I used the 

272
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,90
calling tool to capture the scripts for 
both campaigns, to see what people were 

273
00:17:51,90 --> 00:17:54,870
saying. 
And as you can see here on the screen, 

274
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:59,79
the Romney script did not reflect any of 
the published, widely available 

275
00:17:59,79 --> 00:18:03,564
behavioral research, that has been proven 
to double and triple the impact per 

276
00:18:03,564 --> 00:18:10,282
dollar spent on voter mobilzation. 
I found this baffling and I, I don't come 

277
00:18:10,282 --> 00:18:14,0
at this as I'm presenting this from a 
partisan perspective. 

278
00:18:14,0 --> 00:18:18,620
It was just surprising as someone who 
does research and publishes his research 

279
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,890
to find that the Obama campaign 
internalized this behavioral science to 

280
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,930
maximize its impact when communicating to 
voters and the Romney campaign apparently 

281
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:34,595
didn't use any of it. 
But that said, the research in total has 

282
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:39,530
made a, a ton of progress in about a 
decade of, of focus. 

283
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:42,233
So, with dozens and hundreds of 
experiments focused on how do we 

284
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:45,446
translate behavioral science into 
strategies to increase voter turnout, 

285
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:49,953
we've made substantial progress. 
To make a plan, emphasize high turnout, 

286
00:18:49,953 --> 00:18:53,13
emphasize the voter identity, introduce 
the prospect of post election 

287
00:18:53,13 --> 00:18:58,66
accountability. 
And we've, from this problem of 

288
00:18:58,66 --> 00:19:02,92
increasing turnout, we've managed to 
really build a set of tools and best 

289
00:19:02,92 --> 00:19:06,580
practices that made voter mobilization 
efforts substantially more effective, 

290
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,446
which increased participation in 
elections. 

291
00:19:11,446 --> 00:19:15,538
In the end, this is about increasing 
representative, representation and 

292
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:20,440
increasing participation. 
And it's publicly available research. 

293
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,280
Now, thank you. 
Please vote. 

294
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,466
If you want to learn more, this is my 
website, and I also think, if you are 

295
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,976
interested in this research, here's a
