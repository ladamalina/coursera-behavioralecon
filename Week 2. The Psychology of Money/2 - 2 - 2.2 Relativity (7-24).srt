1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,445
As we said, thinking about money in the
right way is a difficult thing to do so we

2
00:00:03,445 --> 00:00:05,356
find tricks to think about it in a wrong
way.

3
00:00:05,356 --> 00:00:09,376
And one of those tricks is thinking about
money in relative rather than absolute

4
00:00:09,376 --> 00:00:16,951
terms.
So let me first give you some examples to

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:26,275
how to, how to think about it.
A very classic and standard example is the

6
00:00:26,275 --> 00:00:29,931
following.
Imagine you're going to buy a pen, and you

7
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:32,933
find a pen that you like and that pen is
$15.

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:36,908
And as you're about to check it at the
cashier, the cashier tells you, you know

9
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,660
what?
You have such a lovely face.

10
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,723
You have such a lovely smile.
I don't want to abuse you, so I'll tell

11
00:00:43,723 --> 00:00:50,114
you what, our competitor sells the exact
same pen instead of for $15 for $7.

12
00:00:50,115 --> 00:00:54,467
It's three blocks down the street, it's up
to you if you want to buy the pen here or

13
00:00:54,467 --> 00:00:57,410
go to this other place and now you can
think to yourself.

14
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:02,014
Would you walk three blocks down the
street, to save $8 on this pen?

15
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:06,427
And most people when given this decision,
say yes, I will do that.

16
00:01:06,428 --> 00:01:10,495
Now imagine a slightly different case.
You're coming and you're buying a camera,

17
00:01:10,495 --> 00:01:12,481
it's an expensive camera, its cost:
$1,015.

18
00:01:12,482 --> 00:01:16,842
And as you're about to check out, the
salesperson says you know what, you have

19
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:19,709
such a lovely face, you have such a lovely
smile.

20
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,900
I'll tell you what.
Our competitor is selling the same exact

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:29,595
camera, three blocks down the street for
$8 dollars less, instead of $1,015, for

22
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:33,616
$1,007.00 dollars.
Would you now take the trip down to the

23
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:37,770
other store to buy the camera?
And most people now say, absolutely not.

24
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,432
Now the reality is that your checking
account doesn't care where the $8 came

25
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:47,168
from, they came from a pen, or they came
from a camera, or they came from a small

26
00:01:47,168 --> 00:01:50,287
amount of purchase, or a big amount of
purchase.

27
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:56,650
But we care, $8 from 15 looks like a
really big amount, more than half, $8 from

28
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:01,653
1,015 looks like a tiny amount, doesn't
seem to be worth it.

29
00:02:01,653 --> 00:02:07,038
Or think about the following example.
Imagine you buying a car, you're going to

30
00:02:07,038 --> 00:02:12,040
buy a car, the car is $40,000 and the
sales person tells you that for $2,000

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,823
more you could get leather seats.
Now I'm not really sure what the benefit

32
00:02:16,823 --> 00:02:21,651
of leather seats are, but let's say that
there are benefits for the leather seats,

33
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:25,628
and the question is, is it worth $2,000
when you buy a $40,000 car.

34
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:30,787
Or imagine the second case, you going to
buy a chair for your office and the sales,

35
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:36,177
the sales person tells you that for $2,000
more, the chair costs $500, and for $2,000

36
00:02:36,177 --> 00:02:39,830
more you could get the leather seat.
Would you do it?

37
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,414
Now for most people they would say the
first one is an easy decision the second

38
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:47,502
one seem offensive.
Spend $2,000 more on a $500 chair, just to

39
00:02:47,502 --> 00:02:50,426
get leather.
Now presumably, you sit more in your

40
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:54,584
office chair then in the car and whatever
the benefits are from leather would be

41
00:02:54,584 --> 00:02:58,367
higher in the office then in the car, but
that's not how we think about it.

42
00:02:58,368 --> 00:03:04,346
You spend $40,000, $2,000 seems very
small, you spend $500, $2,000 looks

43
00:03:04,346 --> 00:03:08,015
incredibly large.
And here's another example.

44
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:13,148
If you're like me, a couple of times,
we've renovated, our house.

45
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:17,234
And when you renovate your house, the
contractors come and give you an initial

46
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:20,954
price and then there's all kinds of
options for upgrades and changes and so

47
00:03:20,954 --> 00:03:23,906
on.
And what I found myself doing, and I think

48
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:28,815
it's universal, is making very, very quick
decisions on big sums of money.

49
00:03:28,816 --> 00:03:31,914
Why?
Because the renovation is incredibly

50
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:36,378
expensive, so all of a sudden spending
only, you know, x extra thousands of

51
00:03:36,378 --> 00:03:41,058
dollars on, you know, better tile or
French something or another or Italian or

52
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:45,320
counter tops or granite, all of a sudden
seems like a good, a good deal.

53
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,010
But at the same day, that they spend this
huge amount of money in a quick decision,

54
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,630
I can go to the supermarket and look very
carefully, do I want the more expensive

55
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,420
tomatoes then the cheaper tomatoes.
Which one makes more sense?

56
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,586
Now my whole life of making decisions
about tomatoes could not sum up to that

57
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:07,444
snap decision I made a few hours ago with
the contractor.

58
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:12,500
But because the amount of money we start
with, with the contractor is so large,

59
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,098
it's incredibly easy to make snap quick
decisions.

60
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:20,166
And by the way all of this also should
tell you that there are probably ways to

61
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,714
think about how to fight this.
That what we don't want to do, is we don't

62
00:04:23,714 --> 00:04:27,716
want to make a decision based on something
relative that we're spending, we want to

63
00:04:27,716 --> 00:04:32,044
think about them as independent.
And the question is how can we do that?

64
00:04:32,044 --> 00:04:37,416
And now this, these decisions are not just
about how we feel about spending money,

65
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:42,048
they're also about happiness.
So ask yourself for example, what would

66
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:46,532
you prefer to be, to be a person that
makes $90,000 a year, which is a very

67
00:04:46,532 --> 00:04:51,337
good, salary in a company where everyone
makes between 90 and 100.

68
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:58,520
So you're making 90, but you're the lowest
paid employee, versus to work in a company

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,351
that pays less, between 60 and 85,000 and
you're the highest paid employee, you get

70
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:08,615
85,000.
So in an absolute way, you would get paid

71
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:13,115
less in the second company, but in a
relative way you would be at the top at

72
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:17,020
you game, while in the first company you
would be at the bottom.

73
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,916
Now the interesting thing is when you ask
people these choices next to each other,

74
00:05:21,916 --> 00:05:26,812
most people say I'll take the first one, I
prefer to get more money and be the lowest

75
00:05:26,812 --> 00:05:29,864
paid employee.
When you ask people where they would be

76
00:05:29,864 --> 00:05:33,983
happier with, most people recognize,
they'll be probably happy in the second.

77
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:38,290
Okay, So'll be the highest paid employee
even if they get paid less for it.

78
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,442
Now, this is an interesting question of
yes, we do understand the issue of

79
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:46,930
relativity and we do understand the
influence of happiness, but are we willing

80
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,610
to pay a premium for this increased
happiness?

81
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:55,466
And the answer is not so much.
Now if you think about all these examples,

82
00:05:55,466 --> 00:06:01,937
of relativity, they all come about the
fact that we have diminishing returns.

83
00:06:01,938 --> 00:06:05,732
We have this function in which our
happiness starts very high, and then we

84
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,292
have diminishing returns.
And another way to think about it is that

85
00:06:09,292 --> 00:06:12,564
we think in terms of percentages, so ratio
increases.

86
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:17,858
So think about the following graph.
What we have on the x-axis is the amount

87
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:21,967
of money, the physical amount of money,
how much is actually involved.

88
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:26,250
And what we have on the y-axis is the
psychological intensity of that.

89
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,098
Now because this curve has a diminishing
return shape function to it, what does it

90
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:35,132
mean?
It means that if we take an amount of

91
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:39,987
money, on the x-axis, in the left side of
the lower end of the scale.

92
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:44,864
And we take an amount that is exactly the
same in terms of the amount of money on

93
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:49,202
the, far right, they project very
different psychologically.

94
00:06:49,203 --> 00:06:54,130
So this is why, 7, 8 dollars out of 15,
which is represented by the left two

95
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:59,132
columns, look like it has a huge
psychological effect between thirty and

96
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:03,782
forty something on that scale.
Where $8 on the right side of the scale,

97
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:08,418
even though it has the same $8 effect,
psychologically it has a much, much

98
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:12,346
smaller effect.
And this is basically the way that

99
00:07:12,346 --> 00:07:16,100
relativity works, and how diminishing
returns work.

100
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:23,520
And why the same physical amount in terms
of money has very different psychological

101
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,953
implications.
