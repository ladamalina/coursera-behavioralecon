1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,396
I'm Michael Norton. 
I'm an associate professor at Harvard 

2
00:00:03,396 --> 00:00:06,265
Business School. 
And a lot of my research looks at the 

3
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:10,110
relationships between money, time, and 
happiness. 

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,340
And the reason those three things are 
interesting to me. 

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,564
And interesting at the same time, to 
study them is because, we spend so much 

6
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:19,990
of our mental energy thinking about. 
How to be happy and if we're happy 

7
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,790
enough, and I'm not happy today and I 
felt happier last week, or this 

8
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,940
relationship made me happy and this one 
made me unhappy, or should I get a new 

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:31,272
job, or should I talk to my parents more. 
But we don't know a lot about how to make 

10
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:33,886
ourselves happy. 
We have some theories about it, but we're 

11
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:37,71
not really that good always at figuring 
out what the best way is to feel happier 

12
00:00:37,71 --> 00:00:41,892
today and tomorrow and next year. 
And one of the key resources we have for 

13
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:47,20
making ourselves happier is our money and 
another key resource is our time. 

14
00:00:47,20 --> 00:00:50,269
So these are the two things that we have 
some of and we can spend them in 

15
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:53,535
different ways. 
And our research looks at what are the 

16
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:57,400
best ways to spend those two things. 
To spend your money and to spend your 

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,920
time, to make yourself a happier person. 
And the problem with both of those is 

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,350
we're not good at knowing how to spend 
them and they mess us up along the way. 

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,280
And we become less happy instead of more 
happy when we use these resources. 

20
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,600
So, let's start with money. 
So, there's a lot of problems with money. 

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,406
The first one is we think that money is 
going to make us a lot happier than it 

22
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:19,676
actually does. 
So, it turns out that when you make some 

23
00:01:19,676 --> 00:01:22,962
income you do get a little happier if you 
go from being poor to sort of middle 

24
00:01:22,962 --> 00:01:27,520
class But after that it actually really 
starts to taper off. 

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,820
So it's not that more money is bad for 
you, it just doesn't keep making you 

26
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,23
happier in the way you want it to. 
And yet we keep trying to make more and 

27
00:01:35,23 --> 00:01:37,310
more of it. 
We keep trying to get a better job and 

28
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,123
make more money. 
And we're just wrong in terms of how 

29
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,772
happy it's, it's really going to make us. 
And the other problem with money is 

30
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:46,892
separate from this problem, which is just 
it wears off, is that money actually 

31
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:50,600
makes us really selfish. 
So when we get money, the first thing 

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,0
that we think is, what can I do for 
myself with this money? 

33
00:01:54,0 --> 00:01:56,10
So if you thought about if you won the 
lottery today. 

34
00:01:56,10 --> 00:01:58,680
And I said, what do you want to buy with 
the money you won? 

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,752
I bet the first think you would think is, 
what kind of a house, and what kind of a 

36
00:02:01,752 --> 00:02:05,260
car, and what kind of a everything can I 
get for me. 

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,662
And that means, that you're sort of using 
your money for things that are self 

38
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:12,305
focused and inwardly focused. 
And we know that that doesn't necessarily 

39
00:02:12,305 --> 00:02:14,240
make us happy. 
We don't know a lot of really, really 

40
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,676
selfish people. 
If you think in your everyday life, who 

41
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:20,948
are really kind of happy rosy people. 
Usually, they tend to be quite sad and 

42
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:23,498
unhappy. 
Our question really was with, how do we 

43
00:02:23,498 --> 00:02:27,556
switch people's attitudes with money? 
We've got this problem, where money is 

44
00:02:27,556 --> 00:02:30,337
wearing off. 
We've got this other problem where 

45
00:02:30,337 --> 00:02:33,623
money's making you selfish and only 
caring about your own possessions and 

46
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:37,42
your own life. 
We said, is there a way to make this 

47
00:02:37,42 --> 00:02:40,500
curve keep going up. 
So can we make money keep making you 

48
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,860
happy by making you not use it all on 
yourself. 

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,435
That maybe the problem is that we have 
this curve, because we become so selfish 

50
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:51,124
when we get wealthy. 
And if we instead encourage people to use 

51
00:02:51,124 --> 00:02:54,110
the money on anybody else than 
themselves. 

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,527
That might be a source of real happiness 
for people and that might make money keep 

53
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,844
making you happy. 
So the very first way that we tested this 

54
00:03:00,844 --> 00:03:03,724
was in a study that we ran in the 
University of British Columbia and we 

55
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:06,940
literally said, let's just give people 
money, let's just dole out cash to people 

56
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,724
and tell them how to spend it, and 
measure whether it made them happy or 

57
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:14,542
not. 
So we went on campus one morning and gave 

58
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:18,786
people envelopes, filled with money. 
And we said, will you be in our 

59
00:03:18,786 --> 00:03:22,296
experiment and if they said yes we gave 
them an envelope it had some money in the 

60
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:25,752
envelope and there was a slip of paper 
that said to some people by 5:00 pm today 

61
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:31,171
spend this money on yourself. 
That's the way that we usually spend our 

62
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,700
money is on ourselves but to the other 
people we said by 5:00 p.m. 

63
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,240
Today spend this money on somebody else, 
like a gift for a friend, or, or a 

64
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,574
donation to a homeless person. 
Same amount of money, very tiny 

65
00:03:42,574 --> 00:03:45,460
difference in what the slip of paper 
said. 

66
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:48,188
We called them back at the end of the day 
and asked them, what did you with the 

67
00:03:48,188 --> 00:03:52,270
money, and we asked them, how happy are 
you, over the course of the day. 

68
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,130
And it turns out that people who spent 
money on themselves, it wasn't a bad day, 

69
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,770
we gave them $20 and they got to buy 
something, so they weren't less happy 

70
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:01,162
than they were. 
But they didn't get any happier, even 

71
00:04:01,162 --> 00:04:04,530
though they got this free money. 
But the people who we said spend this 

72
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,730
money on somebody else, they actually got 
happier. 

73
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,160
So we asked them, what did you do? 
And they said, oh, I bought a stuffed 

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,830
animal for my niece, or I bought my 
friend a coffee. 

75
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,145
And those things actually led them to be 
much happier at the end of the day, then 

76
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:20,940
doing what they usually do, which is just 
using their money on themselves. 

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,22
Then we thought well that's interesting 
because that means there's some advice 

78
00:04:24,22 --> 00:04:26,782
that you could do right now, today to 
make yourself happier which is quit 

79
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,726
spending all your money on yourself and 
take $5 out of your pocket and spend it 

80
00:04:29,726 --> 00:04:34,919
on Salomone else or give it away. 
But we ran these studies in the United 

81
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:38,980
States and we ran them in Canada, and 
these are pretty wealthy countries. 

82
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,514
Maybe it's the case that if you have a 
lot of money, sure giving it away feels 

83
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:45,256
good. 
But would it be the case if you were 

84
00:04:45,256 --> 00:04:48,770
quite poor in the United States? 
Or even if you lived in a very poor 

85
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,150
country like some Sub-Saharan African 
countries? 

86
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,318
Would we still see that even when you're 
poor and you need money for yourself, it 

87
00:04:55,318 --> 00:04:58,800
still actually can make you happy if you 
give it away? 

88
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,714
So we set out to test that, so we've done 
these same kinds of studies, we give 

89
00:05:01,714 --> 00:05:06,200
people money for themselves or we give 
them money and make them give it away. 

90
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,50
We've done these studies in South Africa, 
in Uganda in Canada, in India, all over 

91
00:05:10,50 --> 00:05:13,960
the world where we've looked everywhere 
we've looked. 

92
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,110
It looks like, when people give money 
away. 

93
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,920
It's better for their happiness, than 
when they spend it on themselves. 

94
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,420
Even when we look at very, very poor 
countries. 

95
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,306
So there's this very basic relationship 
between money and happiness that we're 

96
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:30,300
getting entirely wrong. 
So this, these two problems of, it's 

97
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,110
wearing off over time And we spend it on 
ourselves. 

98
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:37,527
Little tiny shift in your behavior, just 
taking some of that money that you spend 

99
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:40,944
on yourself, people still will buy cars 
and houses and coffee for themselves and 

100
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:44,901
all those things. 
A tiny shift where you take that and 

101
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,86
spend it on someone else, literally 
something as small as buying someone else 

102
00:05:48,86 --> 00:05:51,124
a coffee instead of yourself, changes 
this relationship a bit and gets you 

103
00:05:51,124 --> 00:05:56,190
happier with your money. 
Now let's think about time, so we're 

104
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,520
clearly getting money wrong in some 
sense. 

105
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,930
What about time? 
That's the other thing we have. 

106
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,800
We get some everyday. 
Actually, we get 24 hours of it everyday, 

107
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,38
because there's only 24 hours in a day. 
But we can choose how to spend our time, 

108
00:06:08,38 --> 00:06:11,174
not quite in the same way as spend our 
money, but still, it's a resource, we can 

109
00:06:11,174 --> 00:06:14,212
do whatever we want with it, and we 
decide how to dole it out among different 

110
00:06:14,212 --> 00:06:18,530
things we want to do. 
We're going to eat. 

111
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,40
We're going to sleep. 
We're probably going to watch TV. 

112
00:06:21,40 --> 00:06:23,419
All of these things that we like to do, 
but we can do whatever we want with it 

113
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:26,310
really. 
And again, so remember with money people 

114
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:29,990
often spend it on themselves. 
And it's very about, what I want and what 

115
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,930
I need to do today. 
We find that people do the same thing 

116
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,940
with time that, that they really think 
they should use their time on themselves. 

117
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,990
Everyone reports being stressed about 
time. 

118
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:43,390
Everyone says this, this phrase a time 
famine. 

119
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:46,204
Literally, people feel as though they're 
starved for time and they, if they only 

120
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:49,680
had more time, they'd be happier. 
And the way that they try to deal with 

121
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,280
that feeling is to spend time on 
themselves. 

122
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,630
So they do things like get massages. 
Massages are great, we all love massages. 

123
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:00,800
But just like buying yourself a coffee Is 
nice but it doesn't make you happier. 

124
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,457
Getting yourself a massage is, is really, 
really nice but it doesn't really change 

125
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:07,510
your perception of your time all that 
much. 

126
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,910
You like the massage when it's done, you 
still feel stressed about everything you 

127
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,200
need to get done. 
And also just like with money, remember 

128
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,400
we said that giving money away makes you 
happier than, than spending it in 

129
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,150
yourself. 
It turns out that giving time away. 

130
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:24,513
Actually, makes you feel that you have 
more time, than spending time on 

131
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:27,257
yourself. 
The way that we do these studies to try 

132
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:31,343
to show this is imagine, again one day. 
I send you an email, and say, by 5 o' 

133
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:35,210
clock today, I want you to spend some 
time on yourself. 

134
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,210
And people do things like get massages 
and get a haircut, and all sorts of 

135
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,162
things. 
Other people, again we say, by 5pm today, 

136
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:45,342
spend some time on somebody else. 
Then we asked these people, how do you 

137
00:07:45,342 --> 00:07:47,920
feel about your time? 
Are you stressed about your time? 

138
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,460
Do you still feel like you have a time 
famine? 

139
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,958
Turns out like with money again with time 
if you spend time on yourself you don't 

140
00:07:53,958 --> 00:07:57,390
feel any, any more stressed about your 
time. 

141
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,563
But it doesn't do anything for you. 
You still feel just as stressed as you 

142
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,167
did before, but people who spend time on 
other people they help someone with their 

143
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:07,940
homework or they go volunteer at a soup 
kitchen. 

144
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,730
People do all kinds of things to help 
other people that actually makes them 

145
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,560
feel as though they have more time in 
their day. 

146
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,395
And at first glance it doesn't make a lot 
of sense so you'd think if, if I don't 

147
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:20,273
have enough time for myself. 
How can spending some of it on anybody 

148
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:23,780
else make me feel better, because then 
I'm even busier than I was before. 

149
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,260
But it turns out that when we give to 
other people, it signals to us that we 

150
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,241
have a lot of whatever we're giving away. 
So if I have enough money to dole out to 

151
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:36,430
people, or if I have enough time in my 
life, where I can give it away. 

152
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:40,84
It means that I actually must have a lot 
of time, and that signal to us makes us 

153
00:08:40,84 --> 00:08:44,139
feel better about our time. 
And in fact, we can show that when people 

154
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,63
give time away, they actually become more 
willing to do more things in the future, 

155
00:08:47,63 --> 00:08:49,815
because now they feel much better about 
the stress that they had, about their 

156
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:54,800
time. 
So money, happiness, and time. 

157
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,383
We all want to be very, very happy. 
And we have these two key resources that 

158
00:08:58,383 --> 00:09:02,43
we can spend every day, and over the 
course of our lives, our money and our 

159
00:09:02,43 --> 00:09:05,382
time. 
The way we usually spend them, not 

160
00:09:05,382 --> 00:09:07,910
horrible. 
We're not totally wrong in what we do. 

161
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,260
But we're not spending them optimally, to 
make ourselves the happiest, which is 

162
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,330
our, one of our biggest goals in life is 
to be happy. 

163
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,410
What you can do instead, is any time you 
have some free time. 

164
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,30
And you're thinking, let me spend it on 
myself, give it away. 

165
00:09:22,30 --> 00:09:24,820
Call a friend, help somebody, sign up to 
volunteer. 

166
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,10
Any of these activities that are other 
focused instead of all about yourself. 

167
00:09:29,10 --> 00:09:31,220
Same thing with money, any time you get 
some money. 

168
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,196
And, many of us have enough money to at 
least give some money to charity, and 

169
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:37,540
things like that. 
Your impulse will be, oh, I have some 

170
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,499
money let me spend it on myself. 
Again, the research says giving it away 

171
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:45,239
much, much better for your happiness than 
using it on yourself. 

172
00:09:45,239 --> 00:09:48,931
So, thinking about those three together. 
If you want to get happier, literally 

173
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:52,960
today, many of the things you think are 
the right thing to do. 

174
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,937
Are the wrong thing to do, and you can 
think about all the other things you can 

175
00:09:57,937 --> 00:10:03,803
do instead, that will increase your 
happiness over time.
