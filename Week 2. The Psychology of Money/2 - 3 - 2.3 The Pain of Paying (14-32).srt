1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:06,097
One of my favorite factors in all of the
psychology of money has to do with

2
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:10,530
something called the pain of paying, and
here is the idea.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,650
Imagine that you go to dinner, it's an
expensive dinner, it's a good dinner.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,446
At the end of the dinner you are paying,
and you can pay either with the cash or

5
00:00:22,446 --> 00:00:28,767
with credit card.
Ask yourself which one would feel worse.

6
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,050
Which one would you feel a bit more ting,
a bit more unpleasantness?

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,823
It would kind of diminish they joy of the
meal.

8
00:00:34,823 --> 00:00:39,722
Eh, basically everybody when they ask this
question say the cash would feel worse

9
00:00:39,722 --> 00:00:41,580
than the credit card.
Now why?

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:46,050
Why does the cash feel, feel so different?
You know how much the meal would cost.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,357
This is not surprise.
You see the prices on the menu.

12
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:52,404
But something aout the cash feels
differently.

13
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:56,798
Where is it coming from?
And there is this notion of the pain of

14
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:00,438
paying.
We'd say that the agony of parting with

15
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:05,730
our money has to do with the saliency of
do we see this money going away, and it

16
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:11,190
has to do with the timing of whether the
money is going away at the same time that

17
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:14,250
we're consuming.
So imagine the following example.

18
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,873
Imagine that I own the restaurant, and I
learned over time that people basically

19
00:01:18,873 --> 00:01:22,612
eat 50 bites and pay $50.
That's what everybody does, or more or

20
00:01:22,612 --> 00:01:25,232
less everybody does.
And they came to you and they said it

21
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:28,440
because I like you so much, I'm going to
give you a great discount.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,508
It's going to be 50 cents per bite.
I'll only charge you 50 cents per bite,

23
00:01:32,508 --> 00:01:35,747
and not only that, I'll only charge you
for the bites you eat.

24
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:40,245
So I'll serve you your dish I will stand
back, I will open my little eh, notebook

25
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:44,523
and every time you will take a bite, I
will write a v in this is to indicate how

26
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:48,939
man bites you took and at the end of the
meal, I will charge you 50 cents only for

27
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,550
the bites that you took.
Now ask yourself, is this going to be a

28
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,656
financially efficient meal?
Of course.

29
00:01:55,656 --> 00:01:59,476
You start at 50 cents per bite and only
for the bites You eat.

30
00:01:59,476 --> 00:02:03,687
But how much fun will that meal be?
Probably will be quite terrible.

31
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,940
In fact, in my Ph.D.
Seminar not to long ago I tried that.

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,605
I usually bring lunch for the students in
the Ph.D.

33
00:02:10,605 --> 00:02:16,068
Seminar, and on that particular day I told
them that I'm going to charge them 25

34
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:18,800
cents per bite.
I gave, I brought pizza the same day.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,514
And you know what?
Their bites where so huge.

36
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:24,785
It was awful.
I could basically stuff their face to get,

37
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,613
the maximum amount of bite.
And, you know, they were really good,

38
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:30,530
these are PHD students.
They are really, very well versed in

39
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,110
getting free food and eating very quickly.
But at the end of the day, they did not

40
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,146
enjoy.
Sure, they paid a little less, but the

41
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:43,853
misery was very, was very high.
Here's another way to think about it.

42
00:02:43,853 --> 00:02:46,770
Imagine you're going for a cruise.
It's a cruise to Alaska.

43
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,830
It's a beautiful cruise and you have two
ways of paying.

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,862
You can either pay three months in advance
before you go on the cruise or you can pay

45
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:59,850
the moment you get off the boat.
Which one of those is the economically

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,300
efficient way to pay?
Of course the moment you get off the boat.

47
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,647
You keep the money for longer, you can
invest it and so on.

48
00:03:06,648 --> 00:03:10,536
But ask yourself how would you feel during
the cruise if you know that the end of the

49
00:03:10,536 --> 00:03:15,242
cruise you have to pay all this amount?
Ask yourself, how would you feel in the

50
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:19,400
last day of the cruise knowing that
tomorrow you're going to be parting with

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,054
all this money?
You would probably spend the whole day in

52
00:03:22,054 --> 00:03:25,267
the buffet trying to advertise your
investment, trying to get as much as you

53
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:27,680
can back.
And then, of course, you have to pay a

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,648
trainer or go to the gym, or do something
else to try and get rid of this extra

55
00:03:31,648 --> 00:03:35,675
weight.
So what's interesting here is that we have

56
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:40,834
this notion of the pain of paying and what
the pain of paying does is it adds a moral

57
00:03:40,834 --> 00:03:46,107
tax on to our consumption and because of
that it changes how we feel about payment.

58
00:03:46,107 --> 00:03:48,670
And what's also interesting about this
small tax.

59
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,134
It's about saliency.
It's about how we feel about these

60
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,090
payments, how mu, how a much attention we
give to it.

61
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:59,150
How much do we notice it?
And because of that it can change how we

62
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,087
enjoy the experience.
So think about the following question.

63
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:06,754
Are there cases in which you would like to
increase the pain of paying?

64
00:04:06,755 --> 00:04:11,367
And all the cases in which you like to
decrease the pain of paying.

65
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:17,657
So think about this for, for a minute or
so.

66
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,574
Here are a couple of ways to think about
the pain of paying and is it good or is it

67
00:04:21,574 --> 00:04:24,027
bad.
So for example, I think that if we go

68
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:28,510
around our consumption day by day, we
might want to feel more pain of pain.

69
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,198
We might say to ourself.
You know what them spending too much money

70
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:33,730
and all kind of things.
Let me feel more pain of pain.

71
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:38,930
Let me switch from credit cards, which
disassociate the consumption from the

72
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,950
timing of the payment to cash.
Or if I can't go all the way to cash, we

73
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:47,034
will go to debit card, which give you some
sens of paying at the moment.

74
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:49,848
Maybe I'll sign up for automatic
notification.

75
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:53,756
That, every time I use my debit card, it
would let me know that I just spend some

76
00:04:53,756 --> 00:04:56,660
money, and that would increase, the pain
of paying.

77
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,244
And control my spending, to some degree.
You can also think about the difference

78
00:05:02,244 --> 00:05:06,108
between paying for gasoline, and paying
for electricity.

79
00:05:06,109 --> 00:05:10,408
When we pay for gasoline, we stand in the
gas station, we put the thing in, we press

80
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:14,975
the button and we see this running around.
There's an incredibly high pain of paying

81
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:18,030
feeling to it because we see the amount of
money running.

82
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,970
You could imagine, by the way, an even
worse version.

83
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:23,938
You could imagine that filling the gas
station would take, would be

84
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:26,339
instantaneously and we'd know amount of
money.

85
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,990
But then the gas company will have a
little meter running in your car.

86
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,406
And as you're driving you see how many
cents are being taken away from you bank

87
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:37,193
account.
And every time you press fast on the

88
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:42,316
accelerator it will go a little faster it
will maximize, the pain of paying.

89
00:05:42,316 --> 00:05:47,609
But with gas, even the way it is now,with
petrol , we have this increased high pain

90
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:49,690
of paying.
We see the amount of money.

91
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,247
We buy a lot of it every time.
We see it running around.

92
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:56,885
Think about the electricity.
Electricity, we have no meter in the home,

93
00:05:56,885 --> 00:05:59,330
it's usually outside.
We don't see it progressing.

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,732
It's automatically taken from our checking
account a month and something later, after

95
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,709
we've finished consuming it.
No pain of paying.

96
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,980
Now maybe we should have brought some pain
of paying into it.

97
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,828
For example, what if we put the meter in
the middle of the living room?

98
00:06:13,828 --> 00:06:15,790
Right?
Now you would take it.

99
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,802
Or even better, you know, there used to be
this English system, where for heating a

100
00:06:19,802 --> 00:06:23,578
home you would put coins into the system
and it would heat your house just for a

101
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,125
while.
Imagine your air conditioning and heater

102
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,116
was working like this.
Every time you wanted heat or AC you would

103
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:32,260
put the money in.
And it would, eh, run until you choose and

104
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,952
then you had to put more money in, and now
the pain of paying would increase further

105
00:06:36,952 --> 00:06:40,625
and your house would probably not be as
comfortable as you want.

106
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:45,377
Now, there's some cases we might want to
decease the pain of paying.

107
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:48,946
Imagine you go on vacation.
And you go on vacation, it's expensive

108
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:51,970
place, and you know, you spend lots of
money on it, but in the evening you want

109
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,555
this.
Particular drink martini and it's

110
00:06:57,555 --> 00:07:00,998
expensive.
Now if you feel the pain of paying and you

111
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:05,222
have to pay extra for the martini you
might decide not to have that martini but

112
00:07:05,222 --> 00:07:08,891
is this the right thing.
Well, if you paid for a prepaid vacation

113
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:12,958
that includes everything.
You might spend, in absolute terms, more

114
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,627
money.
But you would not have to think about all

115
00:07:15,627 --> 00:07:19,006
of these small components.
And by not having to think about all of

116
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:22,840
these small components, you might actually
enjoy your vacation to a high degree.

117
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,715
So you can imagine how prepaying for
something, or paying for an all inclusive

118
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:32,440
vacation, or paying to reduce the pain of
paying could actually get you to do

119
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,001
something that you want to do, but have a
hard time doing.

120
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:42,020
And here's one last example of, the agony
of pain of paying, and how to reduce it.

121
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,047
And this has to do with what is an ideal
gift.

122
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,994
Think about it.
What is an ideal gift?

123
00:07:47,995 --> 00:07:51,412
And I don't mean that you could say, you
know, shoes or a backpack or something

124
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:55,396
like that.
What are the characteristics of an ideal

125
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:58,501
gift?
And one thing about an ideal gift is that

126
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:01,647
it removes the pain of paying from other
people.

127
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:05,500
So I'm sure all of you have things that
you want but don't feel right about

128
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,270
geting.
And those are exactly the things that are

129
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,061
great gifts.
Because you want it and this pain of

130
00:08:11,061 --> 00:08:15,770
paying is preventing you from doing it.
So imagine, for example, that you walk

131
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,227
down the street, and, you, at the window
of a store you see a hat.

132
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:23,508
And you put on the hat and it's beautiful.
It's wonderful, it's the right color and

133
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:25,920
size.
Beautiful shape, really interesting.

134
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,760
But then you take it off and you look at
the price and you say to yourself, I just

135
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,350
can't imagine paying this amount of money
for a hat.

136
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,517
Who really buys hat?
You put it back.

137
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:39,950
You go home, and you find out that your
significant other bought the same exact

138
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,049
hat for you, from your joint checking
account.

139
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,126
What do you do?
Do you say, honey thank you very much, I

140
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:50,284
thought about it, I considered it, but I
decided it was not worth it, please take

141
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:53,312
the hat and return it.
Of course not, you would be incredibly

142
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:54,054
grateful.
Why?

143
00:08:54,054 --> 00:08:58,974
Because your significant other has just
taken this pain of paying out of the

144
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:04,150
transaction, giving you only the benefits.
And that's by the way, one of the

145
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:09,516
characteristics of a good, of a good gift.
So going back in general to the pain of

146
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:14,380
paying it means that payment have the
opportunity cost, right, you giving up

147
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,472
something when you buying something which
we don't always notice but is a part of

148
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:22,824
the[UNKNOWN].
It has hassle component, taking cash,

149
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:27,704
taking credit cards and so on.
But it also has a component of the pain of

150
00:09:27,704 --> 00:09:32,618
paying, of a moral tax, of some guilt, it
is associated with the payment, and

151
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:38,078
different methods of payment could create
different amount of guilt and different

152
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,438
timing of payment would create different
guilt.

153
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:44,980
And so it we prepaid for vacation, not so
much guilt.

154
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,270
If we pay for vacation or for meal for
every bite, maximum guilt.

155
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:54,667
If we pay after the fact, like in credit
cards, not so much guilt.

156
00:09:54,668 --> 00:09:59,987
In addition to the timing, the method of
payment also matters.

157
00:09:59,988 --> 00:10:04,672
If you go to a casino, and you take $1,000
and you transition them to chips, now

158
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:09,894
you've basically in your mind taken all
this amount of money and allocated them.

159
00:10:09,895 --> 00:10:15,662
To be spend in the, in the casino.
Not so much pain of paying is involved now

160
00:10:15,662 --> 00:10:19,176
when you spend it.
Or if I gave you $1,000, good for an

161
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:24,588
online store for ten years, the money
would be associated with that particular

162
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:27,234
purchase.
There would be no pain of paying and you

163
00:10:27,234 --> 00:10:32,227
would find it incredibly easy.
To, to spend on that, on that category.

164
00:10:32,228 --> 00:10:36,144
There was a very interesting case about
the pain of paying that happened many

165
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:40,392
years ago with America Online.
America Online, for a long time, used to

166
00:10:40,392 --> 00:10:43,795
charge people by the hour.
In fact, they had two packages.

167
00:10:43,795 --> 00:10:51,768
You could pay $19.95 for 20 hours.
And then plus $2.95 for every additional

168
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:55,099
hour.
Or you can get a smaller package of $9.95

169
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:58,760
for five hours, plus $2.95 for each
additional hour.

170
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,150
But most people took the 20 hours for
$19.95, and they paid additional.

171
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:07,272
And then, at some point, in 1996, at the
end of 1996.

172
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:10,821
Aol decided.
To move to a membership in which there

173
00:11:10,821 --> 00:11:13,420
would be no charge for the additional
hour.

174
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,180
So instead of $19.95 for 20 hours plus
$2.95 per hour, they moved to $19.95 for

175
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,464
all the amount of time that you can
consume.

176
00:11:22,464 --> 00:11:26,689
Now, let's assume that you're going to
make this transition, from this tier

177
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:30,910
system, up to 20 hours and then each
additional hour costs you, to the system

178
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,890
in which You can buy, you could use as
much as you want.

179
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,471
What do you have to try an estimate?
You have to try to estimate how many

180
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:41,954
people are going to start using more.
That was a period that modems were around

181
00:11:41,954 --> 00:11:45,580
and America Online had to decide how many
more modems to have.

182
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,771
So they basically looked at the
distribution of how many people used it

183
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:53,763
and they said that people who were using
more than 20 hours.

184
00:11:53,764 --> 00:11:57,027
They were constrained by the marginal
cost.

185
00:11:57,028 --> 00:12:01,265
So the people who used more than 20 hours
would probably want to use more, maybe

186
00:12:01,265 --> 00:12:06,190
another ten hours, maybe another 20 hours.
These are people that were constrained by

187
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,762
the marginal, cost.
But the people who used 19 hours were not

188
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,350
really constrained.
They could have used another hour.

189
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,241
But they said, you know, maybe people who
used 19 hours were a little bit

190
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:18,239
constrained because they kind of missed
their calculations.

191
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,560
But the people who used ten hours.
Those people clearly didn't have any more

192
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,080
demand.
They could have used another ten hours.

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,788
And don't feel and don't pay for it.
So they look at this distribution, they

194
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:33,428
looked at the number of people who spend
more than 20 hours and assume that they

195
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:36,928
will use much more.
The took a the people who spent 19, and

196
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:41,212
maybe 18 hours and so on and said maybe
they will use a little bit more because

197
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,877
they got confused with the calculation in
trying to keep track.

198
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:50,057
And based on that they increased their
capacity by a tiny amount.

199
00:12:50,058 --> 00:12:54,613
But what actually happened that night?
The demand[SOUND].

200
00:12:55,637 --> 00:12:58,703
Quadrupled, right?
Why?

201
00:12:58,704 --> 00:13:04,300
Because it wasn't just about the 20 hour.
It was about the fact that you, if you

202
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,500
were AOL user, and I was in those days, if
you're an AOL user in those days.

203
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,929
I guess I'm dating myself sorry for that,
but if I.

204
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,410
If you were like me, an AOL user in those
time.

205
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,134
You had the little clock.
A little bit like the gas meter, like the

206
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:20,563
gasoline meter.
That runs around and says, finished 1

207
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:24,237
hour, finished 2 hours.
And even though I might never get to my 20

208
00:13:24,237 --> 00:13:27,037
hours.
This was an annoying feeling.

209
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:30,058
Just knowing what it is.
And it's counting, and going up and up and

210
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:32,579
up, was an annoying feeling.
And because of that.

211
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:37,192
Even the people who were using very little
all of a sudden changed dramatically their

212
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:41,682
behavior and started using much more.
Now to AOL's sad, reality, they were

213
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:46,436
completely unprepared for that.
So that night they had to deal with all

214
00:13:46,436 --> 00:13:50,632
kinds of access demand.
And they had to hire lines and get all the

215
00:13:50,632 --> 00:13:56,108
small operators to, to help them out and,
these small operators were only happy to

216
00:13:56,108 --> 00:14:01,066
you know, stick it them and overcharge
them for this, for this particular

217
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:05,125
privilege.
But this was a case in which AOL should

218
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:10,329
have been prepared, right?
Aol made the rational calculation as if

219
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,447
people, what was stopping them was only
the marginal cost.

220
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:18,156
But if you think about people as what's
stopping them is both the rational cost,

221
00:14:18,156 --> 00:14:20,930
the increased marginal cost, but also the
pain of paying.

222
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:24,430
You would make very different predictions
about what's right and wrong.

223
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,157
And very different predictions about how
your market would look like before such a

224
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,343
change and after such a change.
