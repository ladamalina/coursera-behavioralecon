1
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:11,832
So, imagine that you are a 24-year old
guy, you're going on a date.

2
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:15,210
You've gone to dinner , you had a couple
of drinks.

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:21,079
You're walking with your potential date,
potential long term date to her apartment.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,243
You walk up the steps and as you lean to
kiss her, hoping for a passionate

5
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:34,031
goodnight kiss.
You tell her, interesting, interestingly I

6
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:38,829
spent $124 on the date so far.
How will that date works?

7
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,366
I mean, would you actually get the
goodnight passionate kiss?

8
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:46,641
I'm not proposing this experiment.
I'm not saying you should try it I think

9
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,177
its enough to think about it and to
probably realize that this is not going to

10
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:54,495
work very well.
And its kind of interesting to ask why,

11
00:00:54,495 --> 00:00:58,816
why will it not work very well.
After all, everybody knows what the prices

12
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:01,337
are on the menu and how much the drinks
are.

13
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:04,250
So you've said something that had no
informational benefit.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:08,315
You didn't say anything new, but you
actually have said something.

15
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:14,799
Before that you were on a date, now you're
kind of in a prostitution exchange, money

16
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,750
for, for sex.
And it's not by providing any information.

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:21,656
It's actually mentioning money, or think
about another example.

18
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:25,128
Imagine I asked you, invited you for
dinner at my house.

19
00:01:25,128 --> 00:01:29,803
And you came to dinner and you were going
spend $40 on a bottle of wine.

20
00:01:29,803 --> 00:01:34,034
But you don't know what wine I would like,
red, white, rose.

21
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:39,054
So you say to yourself that you might
spend $40 on a bottle of wine.

22
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:42,081
But I might be able to buy wine I like
even more for $20.

23
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:47,010
So you come to my house and say, Dan,
thanks a lot for inviting me for dinner.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,599
But not knowing what wine you really like
and worrying that I'll waste money on wine

25
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,740
you don't like so much.
Here is $30, go ahead and buy the best

26
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:01,230
wine that you can with $30.
This way, presumably, you will save some

27
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:05,205
money and I would get better wine.
Is that a good strategy?

28
00:02:05,205 --> 00:02:09,811
Economically, yes, but would it in any way
help our friendship?

29
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:13,703
Not so much.
Now, you can see all kind of examples in

30
00:02:13,703 --> 00:02:18,662
which adding money to the equation
actually make things worst.

31
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:25,670
George Bernard Shaw has this joke where he
says he goes to a woman and he says madam

32
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,330
would you sleep with me for money?
And the woman looks at him and says, of

33
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,793
course not, what do you think, I'm a
prostitute?

34
00:02:32,793 --> 00:02:35,941
He looks at her again and he says, what
about for a million dollars?

35
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:39,194
She says you know what, for a million
dollars, I'll sleep with you.

36
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:43,360
And he comes back he said okay now that
we've established you're a prostitute,

37
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,755
let's renegotiate the price.
Now, here's one more example.

38
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:53,370
Imagine if my car broke and I needed
somebody to help me change a tire.

39
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,990
And I came to you and I say look, would
you please help me change a tire on my

40
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:01,794
car?
Ask yourself how likely would you be to

41
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:05,217
help me.
What if instead, they came to you and they

42
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:08,400
say I need help changing the tire on my
car.

43
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,227
Would you please help me?
I'll give you $3 for it.

44
00:03:12,228 --> 00:03:15,928
What would you say now?
Would you be more likely to do it or less

45
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:18,529
likely to do it?
Well here is what would happen.

46
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:22,234
Now, you could probably not tell yourself
that you're doing something for the

47
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:26,230
goodness of mankind, or to help me.
Instead, you would do it as a job.

48
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,694
You would not be able to say, gee, I get
to help Dan to change a tire on his car,

49
00:03:30,694 --> 00:03:33,610
plus I get $3.
These two forces would not add.

50
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:38,387
They will substitute each other.
And now you would say, oh, $3.

51
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,084
I don't work for $3.
Give me 150.

52
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:43,320
We can talk.
But for $3, I don't work.

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,880
And the idea is that once that financial
motivation comes in, the social

54
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:53,048
motivation, feeling good about yourself,
good about your action, actually goes

55
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:56,648
away.
The basic idea here is that we live in a

56
00:03:56,648 --> 00:04:00,320
continuum.
There are things that are in the financial

57
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:05,190
domain, which we call market norms, where
you pay people for their work.

58
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,749
Maybe if you work for me, you know,
helping me I don't know.

59
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,964
Cut the lawn in my house.
I don't actually have a lawn but if you,

60
00:04:13,964 --> 00:04:17,870
if I had one, I could create a contract
with you of how much do you get paid for a

61
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,520
piece of grass or per hour or per square
range or something like that.

62
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,946
That's on one hand.
On the other hand, we have marriage or

63
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:29,270
long term relationship, where we don't
have this exact tradeoffs.

64
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:33,540
And the interesting thing is that we
almost never live in the world that is

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,440
purely money norms.
We always live somewhere in the middle.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,470
There are very few jobs that you can write
a very specific contract for how they

67
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,867
would play out.
So most things are in the middle,

68
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:49,035
somewhere between those two.
And the interesting thing is that once you

69
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:54,010
add financial incentives to the mix, you
actually can make things worse off.

70
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:59,910
Like the example of adding $3 to get you
to help me change a tire on my car.

71
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,514
So let me tell you about the couple of
experiments we've done on this.

72
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:07,855
We ask people to do all kinds of things.
To help us lift a sofa, to do some boring

73
00:05:07,855 --> 00:05:12,100
things on a computer.
And they all look the same in terms of

74
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,970
result.
When we pay people nothing, they work hard

75
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,729
and they're very eager to help.
We add a small amount of money to the mix.

76
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,260
And willingness to work goes down
dramatically, we add a large amount of

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,997
money to the mix, willingness to help goes
up again.

78
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,908
Much like in the tire example, would you
help me for free?

79
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,971
Most likely, yes.
Would you help me for $3?

80
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:39,063
Most likely, no.
Would you help me for $300?

81
00:05:39,063 --> 00:05:43,664
Most likely, yes.
So the interesting thing is that the $3,

82
00:05:43,664 --> 00:05:49,567
the small amount of money that comes in
actually hurts rather than help.

83
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:52,620
And the next thing we asked is what about
gifts?

84
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,129
As we said when we go to peoples homes for
dinner, we don't give them money.

85
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,000
We give them something that is obscuring
the money.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,640
We can give them a gift, like a bottle of
wine or chocolate or something else.

87
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,530
What happens when we give people a gift?
So what would happen if I asked you for to

88
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,057
help me change a tire on my car for
nothing?

89
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:15,280
For a small gift or for a large gift?
Would the small gift work like money where

90
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,000
people would be offended or not?
People are not offended.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,095
The moment you give gifts, you stay in the
social domain and not in the market

92
00:06:23,095 --> 00:06:26,497
domain.
And everything looks, looks better.

93
00:06:26,498 --> 00:06:31,320
And then the next question was what if we
gave people gifts, but we told them how

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,620
much it cost us?
Here's a $0.10 chocolate bar.

95
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,609
Here's a $5 chocolate box.
What would happen when you give a gift?

96
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,482
Like when you come and you give the wine
but you tell the person, thank you so much

97
00:06:44,482 --> 00:06:46,997
for inviting us, here's $30 bottle of
wine.

98
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:50,600
What happens when the money becomes
central to that transaction.

99
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,667
Do people care about what you gave them or
what you got them to pay attention to?

100
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:58,240
Turns out it's what you got them to pay
attention to.

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,760
You gave people a gift but you tell them
how much it costs, it backfires again.

102
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,384
People are reducing their willingness to
help.

103
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:12,444
Now, lots of countries have all kind of
habits about when do you give gifts and

104
00:07:12,444 --> 00:07:15,885
when do you give money.
And particularly for weddings and

105
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:19,450
sometimes birthdays, it's acc-, it's
acceptable to give money.

106
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,294
And money is, of course, efficient.
It's a better gift, from an efficiency

107
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:26,126
perspective.
If you come to my house, by the way, for

108
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:28,927
dinner giving me money's also more
efficient.

109
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:32,759
But if you go to somebody's wedding, it's
incredibly efficient to give the young

110
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,897
couple a check.
And let them buy what they want.

111
00:07:35,898 --> 00:07:41,415
Now, it's not that money's not efficient.
It's that money is not helping nourish the

112
00:07:41,415 --> 00:07:44,493
relationship.
In the same way that if you came to my

113
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:48,647
house and gave me a check instead of a
bottle of wine, if you go to somebody's

114
00:07:48,647 --> 00:07:51,384
wedding.
And you give them a check instead giving

115
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:54,500
them a gift you're not helping your
relationship.

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,599
You will not become better friends
tomorrow.

117
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:59,097
Now, if you think about it, it's really a
continuum.

118
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:04,901
There's cash and checks, there are gift
certificates.

119
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:08,789
There are registry, that people tell you
what they want in advance.

120
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,402
All of those are more efficient than
giving your own gift of what you think.

121
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:18,162
But as the efficiency grow-ups, money is
more efficient than gift certificates,

122
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:21,470
gift certificates are more efficient than
registries.

123
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,862
Or maybe the other way around but heh, so
maybe it's money, registry, gift

124
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:30,563
certificates, and real gifts.
As you think about the efficiency, the

125
00:08:30,563 --> 00:08:35,670
efficiency goes down but the social value
of these things is going up.

126
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:39,000
So we have to think about.
That, that as well.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,430
And how much of the gift is really for the
person.

128
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,597
How much of the gift is because of what
you want them to have.

129
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:49,968
And maybe then cash is ideal.
And how much of it is to nourish the

130
00:08:49,968 --> 00:08:53,362
relationship.
By the way, this same thing also happens

131
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,774
in the work place.
Imagine you worked for me.

132
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:59,355
And image I told you look, I can do one of
two things.

133
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:03,915
I can give you a thousand dollar in cash
or I can send you to a weekend to the

134
00:09:03,915 --> 00:09:06,680
beach.
Now you might look at and you would say

135
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,930
well, give me the cash.
I can maybe go to a cheaper hotel in the

136
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,480
beach and get some new gadget.
So from your perspective the cash would be

137
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,527
more efficient.
But imagine the following question.

138
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:23,680
How would it work if a week from now,
after giving you the cash, I ask you to

139
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,247
come late to the office?
I ask you to come on the weekend, I ask

140
00:09:27,247 --> 00:09:30,039
you to stay late, I ask you to do some
extra work.

141
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,323
And how would it work if I gave you the
gift, without asking you, I gave you the

142
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:38,590
gift rather than the cash.
What the results basically show Is that if

143
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,077
you got the cash you've not build any
social capital.

144
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:46,512
So if the workplace off-, officer asked
you to stay on the weekend at work or late

145
00:09:46,512 --> 00:09:49,658
at night or so on.
You basically would say, and how much

146
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:53,399
would you pay me for that?
But if the workplace gave you a gift, you

147
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,543
all of a sudden moved a little bit in this
social realm.

148
00:09:56,543 --> 00:10:00,746
Now, its a bit more like marriage.
Then work for money, you feel more

149
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:05,751
obligated and the give and take between
the two of you is increasing to a higher

150
00:10:05,751 --> 00:10:08,853
degree.
You'll be willing to do more things for

151
00:10:08,853 --> 00:10:11,980
them.
So the idea here is that there is this

152
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,039
financial norms and there's social norms.
And as we move around them, we get to

153
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,310
sacrifice more, we get to give more, but
we also get to get more.

154
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,588
And as you move closer to a social
relationship, there's much more give and

155
00:10:26,588 --> 00:10:30,435
take, and it's much less precise.
Sometimes I give you a gift, sometimes I

156
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:34,170
expect something from you.
It's not exactly been counting.

157
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,902
Now, I need to give as well, I can't just
expect that, right?

158
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:40,400
It's not just something that happens.
But there is some exchange.

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,752
This I think is also where social benefits
in companies fit in, right?

160
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:49,230
I pay for your healthcare.
I give you a gym.

161
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,554
I get you lunch.
All of those things are not about the

162
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:56,622
financial transactions.
They're about look, I really care about

163
00:10:56,622 --> 00:11:01,321
you and we're going to have some
reciprocation in this more social domain.

164
00:11:01,322 --> 00:11:07,173
Now, imagine that you're in this range
somewhere and then at some point you

165
00:11:07,173 --> 00:11:12,990
switch to the financial domain.
You move into the direction of the market

166
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,262
norms.
What, what will happen?

167
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:19,552
And here is a beautiful experiments, set
of experiments by Uri Gneezy and Aldo

168
00:11:19,552 --> 00:11:22,700
Rustichini.
And they took this daycare center.

169
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,577
And in a daycare center sometimes the
parents were late.

170
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:28,840
And when the parents were late, what
usually happens?

171
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,610
The school teacher looks at her watch, she
looks at the parent, she looks at her

172
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,878
watch.
She makes sure they realize that she's

173
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:37,090
watching them and noting that they're
late.

174
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:40,807
They feel guilty, they apologize and they
take their kid and they try to work

175
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:45,430
better.
But under Uri and Aldo's supervision, this

176
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,817
daycare center basically introduced a
fine.

177
00:11:49,818 --> 00:11:52,260
If the parents were late, they would have
to pay a fine.

178
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:57,772
Now, if the fine was a $1,000, the parents
would probably pull the kids out and move

179
00:11:57,772 --> 00:12:02,535
to a different a different daycare.
But the fine was a few dollars.

180
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:07,557
Now, what happens now?
Imagine you're a parent.

181
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,972
You're there in the office, you're
working, there's an important task, you

182
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,497
look at the watch and you realize you have
to leave now.

183
00:12:13,498 --> 00:12:16,120
But now, there's a fine.
What do you say?

184
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,167
You can say, oh, at this cost, I have
something much more important.

185
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:23,413
The kindergarten can keep my kids for a
few more hours, maybe until 7 in the

186
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,341
evening.
I have more important things here to do.

187
00:12:26,341 --> 00:12:28,680
And what happened?
Exactly that.

188
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,670
All of a sudden, parents were more late.
Now, here is what happened.

189
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,500
They kept running this event, they kept on
running it.

190
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,350
And people became later and later and
later.

191
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,060
Because now, there was no guilt.
It was a cost.

192
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,318
Is it worth it, or is it not?
And then, at some point, they canceled

193
00:12:44,318 --> 00:12:47,456
after a few weeks.
They canceled the fine, and they went back

194
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:51,447
to the, the previous system.
Now, can you go back?

195
00:12:51,448 --> 00:12:56,696
After you move to a market norm, something
that people just do the cost and benefit

196
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,997
analysis, can you introduce guilt all of a
sudden?

197
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:03,648
The answer is, not for awhile.
Probably not until the next school year.

198
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:06,003
Now, parents were more late.
Why?

199
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:09,890
Because you take guilt away.
And then you took the fine away.

200
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,990
And now, there was just no perceived
consequences for being late.

201
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:21,695
So the point here is that once we move to
market norm, it're really hard to recover

202
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:25,090
from that.
And here's another example to, to think

203
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,670
about.
Imagine that you had two credit card

204
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,790
companies.
And one credit card company told you, you

205
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,100
know what, we're your friends and we're
helping you out.

206
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,845
And they send you a cookie, you know, or
they, they gave you a mug or they gave you

207
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:42,129
some, some gifts.
And another said, we are just a credit

208
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,504
card company, it's just business.
Okay.

209
00:13:45,504 --> 00:13:49,887
And then one day you were late paying your
credit card bill.

210
00:13:49,888 --> 00:13:53,490
And they were both gave you a hefty fine,
which is what credit card companies do.

211
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,570
And you called them up.
And you said, I'm really sorry I was late.

212
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,796
My daughter was sick, I got late to the
Post Office, could you please forgive this

213
00:14:01,796 --> 00:14:04,845
fine?
And they both said, no.

214
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:09,326
How would you react to both of those?
The first one had a social relationship

215
00:14:09,326 --> 00:14:12,620
with you, or at least they claimed they
had a social relationship with you.

216
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,855
But if now they say no.
You will basically get incredibly pissed

217
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,860
off.
And you will most likely cancel your

218
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,845
credit card.
Because you had the relationship that was

219
00:14:21,845 --> 00:14:25,560
supposed to be a social relationship.
But now they tell you, you never had a

220
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,660
social relationship.
They don't really understand you.

221
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,161
They're not giving you a discount.
They're not willing to accept your

222
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,024
challenges.
The other company, if they said no.

223
00:14:34,024 --> 00:14:37,000
You don't get to be upset.
They never promised you anything.

224
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,540
It was just business.
There are strict rules, here it is.

225
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,447
So what happened?
The second company people are not upset.

226
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:48,608
So when we think about it, where do we
want to be in the range between market

227
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:52,248
norms and social norms?
As we move as a company toward the social

228
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:56,670
norms, we can expect more from people, to
forgive us more from time to time, to be

229
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,092
willing to accept, to do extra things,
more variance less been counting, but it

230
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:04,116
also has a cost.
It means that we need to actually build

231
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:07,062
the other side.
We need to help, we need to be there when

232
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:11,352
something breaks so we are not just
expecting social norms, we're also giving

233
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:16,316
social norms.
So how do we think about this whole notion

234
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:21,102
of market norms versus social norms?
In economics, there's a general way to

235
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:24,578
describe contracts.
And we think of them as complete contracts

236
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:28,460
and incomplete contracts.
And complete contracts are things that we

237
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:32,294
can specify exactly what you would do and
what you would get.

238
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:36,988
And the reality is that we try to make
contracts with people always complete,

239
00:15:36,988 --> 00:15:41,611
exactly about what will happen, but the
reality is that it's incredibly difficult

240
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:45,805
to write complete contracts.
So now the question is, what is better, to

241
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:50,590
write partially complete contracts or to
try and write incomplete contracts?

242
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:54,220
Contracts that general and me specified.
Something like a marriage.

243
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,850
You don't sit there and write the whole
contract of what you will do and what they

244
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:00,788
will do.
You basically say, we will take care of

245
00:16:00,788 --> 00:16:03,616
each other.
We will try to make it so that in the long

246
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:07,008
term, things would work out.
Sometimes you will do more, sometimes I

247
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,300
will do more.
I will, not sure what the circumstances of

248
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,208
our lives will be, but we will adjust and
change accordingly.

249
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:18,464
And the idea is that I think we're
thriving too much for the complete

250
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:21,769
contracts.
Because as we try to write everything in

251
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,633
the contract, the things that govern the
contract, the social norm above it,

252
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:29,929
basically go away.
If I write a specific contract with you,

253
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:34,024
if something new comes and something
different, you're going to adhere to the

254
00:16:34,024 --> 00:16:36,640
letter of the law and not to the spirit of
the law.

255
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,894
But as we move to more general contracts.
With handshakes and general agreement and

256
00:16:42,894 --> 00:16:47,277
less specific things, we basically agree
to adhere to the spirit of the law.

257
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:50,920
And not to the letter of the law and
sometimes it's much better.

258
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,129
Now, I actually think it's quite a shame
we're taking all of these general

259
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,814
contracts and try to make them more
specific.

260
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:02,504
Because we can't make them really specific
enough and by doing this, we're actually

261
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:06,799
killing them.
I'll give you kind of one, one example

262
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,137
that has been I think resonates with me a
lot.

263
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:15,127
Imagine a janitor in a hospital and
imagine this janitor has a very specific

264
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:20,183
rule about what they're suppose to do,
pick the trash and mop and do and do some

265
00:17:20,183 --> 00:17:23,238
things.
What happened if one day a patient is

266
00:17:23,238 --> 00:17:28,373
falling on the ground from their bed or
somebody else needs help in finding out

267
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:32,224
their relatives?
Berry Schwartz gives this example and he

268
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:37,450
says, of course, you would not want this
individual to adhere to the letter of the

269
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:40,480
law.
You would want to adhere to the spirit of

270
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,256
the law.
But what happens if you get this person to

271
00:17:44,256 --> 00:17:47,017
have a very, very detailed job
description?

272
00:17:47,018 --> 00:17:51,791
Are you losing, are you basically losing
the potential that you would go beyond his

273
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,380
job?
By restricting the job and making it

274
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,472
incredibly specific, are you focusing on
doing only what's there and not what's

275
00:17:59,472 --> 00:18:03,493
really important?
So I think the interesting question is,

276
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:07,756
what kind of contracts do we want?
And what kind of contracts would get

277
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:12,040
people to be happier and more motivated
and be willing to do more?

278
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:16,525
Both in the professional domain and in a
private domain.

279
00:18:16,526 --> 00:18:22,577
And as a last, last story on this.
There was a woman who put an ad in

280
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:27,128
Craigslist.
And she said she's beautiful and qualified

281
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:33,034
and wonderful in all kinds of ways.
And she usually sees very beautiful women

282
00:18:33,034 --> 00:18:37,160
like her dating men who make at least
$500,000 a year.

283
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,080
This was in New York City before the
financial crisis.

284
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,730
So she said look, I'm as beautiful as
these women who are dating men who make

285
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:48,873
$500,000 a year or more.
But I personally have been stuck, I got

286
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:53,103
into the $250,000 barrier.
I have not been able to break that

287
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:56,284
barrier.
I can't date men, I can't find, seem to

288
00:18:56,284 --> 00:19:02,328
find men who are making more than that.
And she asked for advice and suggestions

289
00:19:02,328 --> 00:19:05,559
of how to go about it.
Now, the reality is that it's true,

290
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:10,356
beautiful woman marry wealthier guys.
That's just kind of the realization of the

291
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:14,007
market.
But she said it in a very explicit way.

292
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:18,576
And you can ask yourself, what does it do
to you if, if the contract is so explicit,

293
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:23,049
I'm beautiful, I'm getting money, kind of
makes the whole thing dirty.

294
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,566
Imagine you made the contract.
Imagine you made enough money to satisfy

295
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:29,960
her.
And she was beautiful enough in your mind,

296
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,720
and you got together.
How would this relationship look like?

297
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,412
What would happen on the first night she
doesn't want to have sex or doesn't want

298
00:19:37,412 --> 00:19:41,439
to, to be a good, a good partner, right?
It's a really strange transaction of

299
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,739
saying beauty for money.
And indeed, one guy wrote her back.

300
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:49,497
And he said, look, I'm wealthy enough.
I make more than the required amount.

301
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:54,071
And you seem very beautiful.
And I think this is a reasonable deal.

302
00:19:54,071 --> 00:19:59,855
But, he said, my assets, which is money,
is likely to appreciate over time.

303
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:05,100
And your assets, which is beauty, is
likely to depreciate over time.

304
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,390
And under those conditions, he said, I
prefer to lease than to buy.

305
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:16,056
And you can see how putting out an offer
that is, has a social component of living

306
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:20,619
together, but putting it in terms of
market norms.

307
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,473
Actually invites a very different way of
thinking about the relations and think

308
00:20:25,473 --> 00:20:27,973
about her and its very unlikely to work
out.

309
00:20:27,974 --> 00:20:33,474
So, think about your relationships, think
about where they lie on this range for

310
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:38,248
market norms to social norms.
And where would they be ideally, both the

311
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:42,184
social relationships, business
relationships and so on.
