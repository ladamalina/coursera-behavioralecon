1
00:00:00,707 --> 00:00:07,769
One of the economic dreams about pricing
things on the internet is to partition

2
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:14,310
things to small amounts, and charge people
only for the things they take.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:19,454
And this is called micro-pricing.
You're getting software, maybe you don't

4
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:23,282
pay for the whole software, you only pay
for the feature that you're using and so

5
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:25,706
on and so forth.
You're not getting a whole album, you're

6
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:29,939
just getting the songs that you want.
And the question is, is micro-payment a

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,640
good idea or a bad idea?
Now, what we talked about, which is the

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,774
pain of paying, suggests that this might
not be ideal.

9
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:42,332
That in fact, thinking a hundred times
about whether to pay one penny could be

10
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:46,404
much, much worse than paying in one time
one dollar, right?

11
00:00:46,404 --> 00:00:51,600
So these things did not accumulate.
So together with Joseph Silver, we tried a

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,727
couple of experiments, and here is what we
did.

13
00:00:54,727 --> 00:01:00,059
We got people in the lab, and we say,
look, for the next hour, you have to, you

14
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,938
can do only one of three things.
You can read cartoons and this will cost

15
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:10,056
you some money.
You could read news or sports and this

16
00:01:10,056 --> 00:01:13,450
would cost you less.
Or you could look at post-modern

17
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,747
literature.
And this would be for free.

18
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:19,064
This by the way, the post-modern
literature was not really a post-modern

19
00:01:19,064 --> 00:01:23,186
literature.
The was a, a website that was generating,

20
00:01:23,186 --> 00:01:27,610
generating random sequences that looked
like post-modern literature.

21
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,277
And the subjective feeling I had reading
them, is that.

22
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:34,068
When you read these things, everything
looked like it was making sense.

23
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:37,160
But, in fact, when you finished a, a
sentence or a paragraph.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,470
You said to yourself, what, what was this
that I just, I just read?

25
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,979
And I was into it.
It sounded like it was making sense.

26
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,115
But I have no idea what it is, and the
people who designed this website, this was

27
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:49,891
their idea of what post-modern literature
really is.

28
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:53,497
Anyway, so, this was by the way, not
really fun to do.

29
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:58,683
So, cartoons, extra fun, you pay more,
news and sports, you pay less.

30
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:01,009
Post-modern literature, you could do for
free.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,485
And this was the same for everybody, but
we had groups of people that were faced

32
00:02:07,485 --> 00:02:11,900
with different payment mechanisms.
We gave everybody $10, and some people we

33
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,084
put them in the micro-payment condition.
Which meant that for every piece of thing

34
00:02:16,084 --> 00:02:19,561
they were going to pay, not the post
literature, but the post-modern

35
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:22,634
literature, but for the[COUGH] cartoons
and for the news.

36
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:26,103
It would prompt them and say, hey, would
you like to pay for this?

37
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:31,026
And the cost was very, very cheap.
The cost was one penny for the cartoons

38
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:35,968
and half a penny for news and sports.
Not a lot of money, but they would, they

39
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:38,114
would pay for it.
Say, hey, would you like, are you sure you

40
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:39,619
want to pay for it?
So they had to do that.

41
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,016
Another group of people did the same
thing, and we charged them the same way,

42
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,387
the piecemeal, but we charged them at the
end.

43
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:51,131
This is kind of like electricity bill.
You consume and you consume and you

44
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:54,643
consume and you consume.
At the end, you pay for it.

45
00:02:54,644 --> 00:02:57,848
Another group, we got them to prepay.
We got them to put some money in an

46
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:00,095
electronic wallet.
Then we say, hey.

47
00:03:00,095 --> 00:03:02,754
This is just going to deduct money as you
go along.

48
00:03:02,754 --> 00:03:06,737
And finally, we had another group that
had, a subscription.

49
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:09,538
They could pay for the whole thing.
Right?

50
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,961
And they would pay like a package deal
that gave them access to everything that

51
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,214
they wanted.
What did we find?

52
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:22,594
We find that the people who got the
subscription paid much, much more than the

53
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:27,162
people who got the micro-payment.
In fact the people in the micro-payment

54
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:30,802
condition spend most of their time.
Reading post-modern literature.

55
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:33,650
And, by the way, having a really miserable
time in it.

56
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,190
On average, I think they paid basically
four pennies that's it in this hour.

57
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,118
So they hardly paid anything.
Every transaction, half a penny, penny,

58
00:03:42,118 --> 00:03:45,366
was just too much for them.
They decided they much rather read the

59
00:03:45,366 --> 00:03:48,366
post-modern literature, the fake
post-modern literature.

60
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:50,518
And they were quite miserable with the
whole thing.

61
00:03:50,518 --> 00:03:53,480
The people who got the subscription were
much happier why?

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,773
They paid much more.
Right?

63
00:03:55,774 --> 00:03:59,163
They paid much, much more, ten times more.
But they were happy.

64
00:03:59,163 --> 00:04:03,294
To do it, because they were not
encountering this decision every time,

65
00:04:03,294 --> 00:04:06,759
should I pay half a cent, should I pay a
penny, and so on.

66
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,950
And then what about the people who paid
the end versus the people paid in the

67
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,620
beginning?
Which one was better?

68
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,588
Well, it turns out the people who paid in
the beginning spend more money.

69
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:20,665
Why?
Because of they put it in an account

70
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:23,693
already.
They sign it to an account, this account

71
00:04:23,693 --> 00:04:27,126
was a sign.
To get money for this particular purchase,

72
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:29,928
it was tougher.
So, if you look at the order of these

73
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:33,847
effects, people in the micro condition,
micropayment paid the least.

74
00:04:33,848 --> 00:04:38,240
People in the post condition paid more.
The pre-condition, they paid more.

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,699
And the most was paid by the people in the
subscription.

76
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,024
Now, the other interesting thing from this
experiment.

77
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:48,231
Is that people basically realize this
effect.

78
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:52,662
At the end of the study we asked people,
hey, by the way, in which condition would

79
00:04:52,662 --> 00:04:55,174
you have liked to be?
And even in the people in the

80
00:04:55,174 --> 00:04:59,002
micro-payment condition said, you know
what, we would have been much better in

81
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:01,110
the subscription condition.
Why?

82
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,480
We don't like making decisions about one
penny and one penny.

83
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,845
We don't, we don't like those decisions.
We would much prefer to pay for everything

84
00:05:07,845 --> 00:05:11,598
and enjoy it to a higher degree.
They would have preferred to eliminate the

85
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:16,610
pain of paying from their ways.
And I want us to think about two things in

86
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,584
this regard.
One is if you look at something like the

87
00:05:19,584 --> 00:05:21,990
iTune stores, everything is kind of the
same price.

88
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,207
Or maybe they have two, two prices for,
for songs.

89
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:29,509
Why not have lots of prices?
Why $0.99?

90
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,070
Why not some of them be 87 and 91 and 101
and so on?

91
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:37,850
And the idea is that if all the songs have
the same price or two price points we

92
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,733
basically say yes or no.
But if there's lot of variability in the

93
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:49,120
prices all of a sudden, it makes the
decision much more difficult.

94
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,300
Is this worth another penny, should I pay
another $0.03?

95
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,700
And we start thinking about small amounts
of money.

96
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,462
And thinking about these small amounts of
money might make the experience less

97
00:05:58,462 --> 00:06:02,518
appealing.
So having prices that are the same, maybe

98
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:07,479
like the dollar store, actually make
things much more.

99
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,321
Easy for us to process.
We don't look at small prices.

100
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,370
We don't start weighing them against other
things.

101
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,682
We just decide, do we want it or not?
The other point I want to make is about

102
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:22,297
the App Store.
And there's a couple of points that are,

103
00:06:22,297 --> 00:06:28,506
are actually worthwhile making about this.
The first one is that the App Store has

104
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:34,660
basically very few very few prices.
And you can ask yourself what would of

105
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,480
happened if there were more different
prices out there.

106
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,880
It would have been incredible difficult to
make these decisions.

107
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,015
But the moment they've settled on a few
prices, this decision is becoming much

108
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,172
easier.
Now, when you buy things on the App Store,

109
00:06:49,172 --> 00:06:53,047
I don't know if you've realized, but Apple
waits a little bit.

110
00:06:53,048 --> 00:06:57,348
They wait a little bit, and they try to
send you a receipt with multiple things

111
00:06:57,348 --> 00:06:58,856
that you bought.
Why?

112
00:06:58,856 --> 00:07:02,150
Because it actually reduces some of your
pain of paying.

113
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,228
It puts things together.
So, rather than send you an email, hey,

114
00:07:05,228 --> 00:07:08,248
you bought something for $0.99 and hey,
you bought something for $0.99 cents.

115
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:12,717
It's sends you and email and says you've
done all of those things together.

116
00:07:12,717 --> 00:07:17,389
By the way, this strategy also saves them
some money on the fee with the credit

117
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,373
card.
But in addition, it reduces the che-, the

118
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:24,424
feeling of the pain of paying, making it
less of a micro-payment.

119
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:28,035
How does the eye still make things look
even less like micro-payments?

120
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:32,900
Gift certificates, or prepayment right?
If you buy a $25 or $50 certificate for

121
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,730
the iTunes store, all of a sudden you have
an account that you associate with buying

122
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,948
these things.
You, you, you draw down on it, but you

123
00:07:40,948 --> 00:07:44,814
don't feel in the same way that you're
doing micropayments.

124
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:50,888
The final thing I wanted to say about the
App Store, which relates to the psychology

125
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:55,352
of free, is that I think it has been a
tremendous mistake to include price of

126
00:07:55,352 --> 00:08:00,310
free as one of the options.
I see people all the time buying the free

127
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:04,802
apps when a, a better version of the app
exists at $0.99.

128
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:08,153
And it's not as if those are people that
don't have 99 cents.

129
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,807
Those are the same people who then go for
a latte, and spend $4 on a cup of coffee.

130
00:08:12,808 --> 00:08:15,712
They could have spent one cup of coffee
less a day.

131
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:21,419
And upgrade four of their apps.
But the moment the price of free exists.

132
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:27,130
As a version of the app, spending $0.99
more is not just a direct increase.

133
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,011
Oh, this is what I'm not saying this is
what I'm willing to pay, and what are the

134
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,532
other benefits.
Now, the moment something has a free

135
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:36,128
version, the free version is so much more
appealing that it's taking a

136
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:40,163
disproportional size of the market.
And all of a sudden, people are much more

137
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:43,499
appealing to it.
And the reason why I think this is a shame

138
00:08:43,499 --> 00:08:46,974
because I think its killing the paid
market for the apps.

139
00:08:46,974 --> 00:08:51,838
What would happen, you can ask if free was
not an option if the lowest price was

140
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:56,111
$0.05 or $0.10 cents or $0.25.
Under those conditions the appeal of a

141
00:08:56,111 --> 00:08:58,860
small price would not have been that
strong.

142
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,392
An app store that has.
A free version, and a version at $0.99,

143
00:09:03,392 --> 00:09:06,600
create a huge barrier to switch to the
$0.99.

144
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,227
An app store that has something at $0.05
and $0.99, now the barrier is not as high.

145
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:17,505
It's only 90 eh, $0.94 more sense.
It's not the same as moving from free to a

146
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,536
paid.
And if you think about the ecosystem of

147
00:09:20,536 --> 00:09:23,460
app developers.
There's a question of how do we support

148
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:26,705
these activities?
People are developing all kinds of stuff,

149
00:09:26,705 --> 00:09:29,530
initially, for free out of an interest in
this.

150
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:33,717
But if this ecosystem is not going to
support them, people are going to stop.

151
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:37,314
Or the kind of app that will appear would
be very specific, and eh, many people

152
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:40,130
would not make them.
If think, if you, we really wanted to

153
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,500
support this ecosystem.
Both on the Android side and on the Apple

154
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,940
side, it's important not to create the
zero price because the gravitation to zero

155
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:54,137
is too much, and it would actually
undermine the whole market.

156
00:09:54,138 --> 00:09:59,499
So to summarize, the psychology of money
is a really interestingueh topic.

157
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,025
Eh, we think we're experts with money.
We use money all the time, but if you take

158
00:10:04,025 --> 00:10:06,635
a step back, you realize how interesting
It is.

159
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:09,907
And not only is it interesting its going
to become more interesting.

160
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:14,450
We're inventing electronic wallets, we're
inventing new way of payment.

161
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:18,336
We're inventing ways for people to pay
each other, to split checks differently,

162
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:22,297
to pay merchants differently, for
merchants to pay other people differently.

163
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:25,012
We have circle lending we have all kinds
of things that are emerging.

164
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:29,640
And of course those would make it more
interesting to study, but we should also

165
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,637
ask ourselves, how do you want these
payment methods to look like?

166
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:37,987
If we're designing a new electronic
wallet, how do we want it to look like?

167
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:41,700
Do we want it to make people make better
decisions or worse decisions?

168
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,684
Do we want it to be better for the
merchants or for the individuals?

169
00:10:44,684 --> 00:10:49,378
For long term savings or short term fun?
Do we want to eliminate the pain of

170
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:53,290
paying, or do we want to make it central.
I think it's incredibly important.

171
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,706
We are the designers of our money.
And we have to understand how money works,

172
00:10:57,706 --> 00:11:01,211
and think about how do we want to design
the payment method.

173
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:04,172
So they will actually make us the best of
we can.

174
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:42,724
