1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:05,096
Free, of course, is a very, very exciting
price.

2
00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:11,624
We see people doing all kinds of crazy
things, or seems to be crazy things, for

3
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:14,956
free.
We see relatively wealthy people stand a

4
00:00:14,956 --> 00:00:19,876
long time in line to get free Ben &
Jerry's ice cream, or get something for

5
00:00:19,876 --> 00:00:22,472
free.
And you can ask yourself, would the same

6
00:00:22,472 --> 00:00:26,463
people stand in line for the same amount
of time to get free you know, $2.25.

7
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:31,793
Most likely not.
We see sometimes, people in flights, cross

8
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:37,029
Atlantic flights, where the alcohol is
free, drinking lots and lots of alcohol on

9
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:40,580
those flights.
Of course making their ability to recover

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,843
from the hangover, from the jet lag, much,
much lower.

11
00:00:43,843 --> 00:00:49,612
There's all kind of things that seems to
be, questioning our ability to think

12
00:00:49,612 --> 00:00:55,090
rationally when free is involved.
And, but, but these are not exact tests of

13
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:59,057
this idea, so we tried to examine it a
more precise way.

14
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:04,205
So imagine I gave you the following, I
said look you can have this truffle, this

15
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:11,620
wonderful chocolate truffle for .25 cents.
Or you could have this small little candy,

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,675
for 1 penny.
How are you sup-, and you can have only

17
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,407
one of the two, how should you look at
this choice?

18
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:20,946
You should say, what's the benefit of this
truffle?

19
00:01:20,946 --> 00:01:25,235
How much joy am I expecting to get?
How much cost does it have?

20
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:29,274
25 Cents.
And how much joy am I expecting to have

21
00:01:29,274 --> 00:01:33,737
from this small candy?
And how much cost does it have, one cent.

22
00:01:33,738 --> 00:01:39,043
So in reality, when you, given the choice
between the two, you should say what the

23
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:43,620
difference in price is 24 cents.
How is the difference in price compared to

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,471
the difference in quality?
If the difference in quality is larger,

25
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:50,530
then you should say, let's get the
expensive truffle.

26
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:54,556
If the difference in quality is not worth
the price difference, you should say,

27
00:01:54,556 --> 00:01:57,870
let's get the cheap chocolate.
Now what happen when you give people this

28
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,842
choice?
Most people, the vast, vast majority said,

29
00:02:00,842 --> 00:02:04,150
give me the better, the better truffle for
more money.

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,259
But what if we reduce both prices by
$0.01?

31
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:13,669
Instead of, let's say, 25 and 1, it's 24
and 0.

32
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:17,286
What happens now?
It's the same computation should carry

33
00:02:17,286 --> 00:02:19,223
out.
What's the difference in price?

34
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:21,298
24 Cents.
What's the difference in quality, the same

35
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:22,780
thing.
Which one is larger?

36
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,667
But that's not what happened.
Now most people go for the one for free.

37
00:02:27,668 --> 00:02:32,110
Most people say oh, this one is free.
And they just go for it, almost, almost

38
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,826
everybody.
Now you could say, well you know when

39
00:02:34,826 --> 00:02:39,050
something is free, you don't have to take
your wallet out, you don't have to pay,

40
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,760
and so on.
So we also did this experiment when people

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,088
checked out from the supermarket.
People bought all kind of things, they

42
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:51,539
were going to pay anyway, and then at the
cashier, they saw these two offers, either

43
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:54,450
25 and 1 or 24 and zero.
They were going to pay anyway.

44
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,410
They were going to take out their credit
card or cash and pay anyway, so it was not

45
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,204
adding to the hassle in any way.
But what happened now?

46
00:03:01,204 --> 00:03:04,970
Still, people like the one, the one with
the zero.

47
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,850
So the idea here is that the moment
something involves zero, we're overly

48
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,473
excited with it.
We don't see the downside.

49
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:16,438
You know, even if you're in line, standing
for a long time for a free Ben & Jerry's

50
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:19,610
ice cream, you don't see the cost.
You don't see the cost of your time.

51
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,279
You think about this much more emotionally
appealing.

52
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:27,315
One of my favorite experiments on this, by
the way, was with kids.

53
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:32,244
This was Halloween, so I was standing out
at my house on the porch.

54
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:37,127
And kids were coming, and as they were
coming I said please put your hand out.

55
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:41,040
And they put their hand, and I put some
Hershey Kisses on, some small candies on

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,190
it.
I said don't put it back in your bag, hold

57
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:47,077
it on.
Once they had it in their hand, I said,

58
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:52,390
now I can either give you a small Snickers
bar, one ounce, or large Snickers bar, two

59
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:55,365
ounces.
And just have to get you calibrated, every

60
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:59,919
ounce of a Snickers bar holds between
seven and eight Hershey kisses in terms of

61
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,900
weight, so what's the right, what's the
right deal?

62
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,657
Here's what I offered them, I said to half
of them, I said if you give me one Hershey

63
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:11,790
kiss I'll give you the small one.
If you give me two Hersey kisses I'll give

64
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,360
you the big one.
So for one extra investment of a Hersey

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,177
kiss they could get another ounce of
Snickers bar.

66
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:23,950
Paying them 7 to 1 in chocolate per
weight, plus I think it's a better

67
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,882
chocolate.
And what happens?

68
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:30,544
The kids saw this good, deal they gave me
two Hersey kisses an took the big one.

69
00:04:30,545 --> 00:04:35,698
That's great, but in this way, both
transactions, the small Snickers bar and

70
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:39,577
the large Snickers bar, involve them
giving me something.

71
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:42,297
For another group of kids, I reduce the
price.

72
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:46,885
I said, what would you like, the small
Snickers bar for nothing, or the big

73
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:51,395
Snickers bar for one Hershey kiss?
Now again they had to give one extra

74
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:55,150
Hershey kiss to get the big one and again
it's a great deal.

75
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,840
High return on investment, better
chocolate.

76
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,240
What happened?
Now almost nobody wanted it.

77
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,120
So all of these ideas suggest that once
something is free, or at least it's

78
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,060
phrased as free, we don't see the cost of
it.

79
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,842
We don't see the downside of it and we're
overly attracted to it.

80
00:05:13,842 --> 00:05:16,150
Now you can think about all kinds of
things in the market.

81
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,910
You can think all kinds of things that, we
should make free if we want to incentivize

82
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,664
people to behave in a certain way.
For example, maybe we want to take some

83
00:05:26,664 --> 00:05:30,562
unpleasant medical exams, and not have any
co-pay for them.

84
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:34,745
Y'know, I don't know anybody who wants to
have colonoscopies, for example, right?

85
00:05:34,745 --> 00:05:39,568
Why do we have a co-pay for colonoscopy?
Maybe we should have it at zero and that

86
00:05:39,568 --> 00:05:44,260
would get people to be more attracted to,
to this exam, or at least less repulsed by

87
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,389
them.
Maybe we want to take, eh, examples when

88
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:51,721
we give people tax, tax discounts to do
something that is good for the

89
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,730
environment.
Maybe tax discounts are not enough, maybe

90
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,850
we should make it free.
The moment you understand that free is a

91
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,930
special price, that people think about it
as different than all other prices, you

92
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,770
could think differently about how to
implement it and how to get people to use

93
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:10,947
it.
The last thing I want to say about, the

94
00:06:10,947 --> 00:06:15,667
price of zero is that it also works for
part of the product.

95
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:19,537
So for example, imagine that I'm selling
you a book.

96
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:25,660
And I can sell you the book for $15, and I
can sell you the shipping of the book for

97
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,398
$5, so together it's $20.
So together it's $20 and imagine three

98
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:32,013
ways.
I can either send you the book for $10 and

99
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:35,010
shipping for $10.
I can sell you the book for $20 and

100
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,046
shipping for 0.
Or I can sell you the book for 0 and

101
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:41,597
shipping for $20.
All of those are financially equivalent.

102
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,247
Which one is the worst?
They want that you're paying for the book

103
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:50,007
and you're paying for the shipping, $10
each, because now, you don't get anything

104
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:53,740
for free.
In contrast, what happens when the book is

105
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,283
20 and shipping is zero, that's great.
But when the book is zero and 20 is

106
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:02,177
shipping, that turns out to be the best,
now you can think about getting the book

107
00:07:02,177 --> 00:07:05,784
for nothing.
And a final advice for life.

108
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:10,744
Eh, when you go out to dinner, with
friends, there's all kinds of ways in

109
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:14,347
which you can manage the bill at the end
of the meal.

110
00:07:14,348 --> 00:07:18,447
And I think the worst way to deal with
this is for each person to see exactly

111
00:07:18,447 --> 00:07:23,034
what they ordered and exactly split the
bill accordingly to whats correct.

112
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:27,160
And the reason why I think it's a bad
ideal, is because the end of the

113
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,940
experience changes dramatic how we view
the whole experience.

114
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:34,009
And if, at the end of the meal, you're
going to penny pinch and worry about

115
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,268
something, and debate with somebody.
Oh, you had to bite from my, creme brulee,

116
00:07:38,268 --> 00:07:40,807
and I took an olive from your salad and so
on.

117
00:07:40,807 --> 00:07:45,250
And that's kind of going to put a damper
on the end of the experience, and

118
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,926
therefore make it less appealing.
A better approach, you just split the

119
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,815
bill.
No matter what you got, let's split, split

120
00:07:51,815 --> 00:07:55,146
the bill, in general.
Now with some people it might not work as

121
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:58,214
well, and sometimes people eat
dramatically different things, but in

122
00:07:58,214 --> 00:08:02,474
general it's a good strategy.
But the strategy I like the best is for

123
00:08:02,474 --> 00:08:06,390
one person to pay, and to alternate who is
paying.

124
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,460
Why do I like this approach?
Because two things, one is the pain of

125
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,169
paying and the other one is the effect of
free.

126
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,036
If you're going out with one friend, and
you're buying, and they're getting it, for

127
00:08:18,036 --> 00:08:22,460
them, they got the free meal, it's great.
And free meal is not just $1 less than

128
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:27,730
paying $1, or not just $20 less than 20,
free meal is a special thing, you get

129
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,790
extra happiness out of that.
And of course next time you would get the

130
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,092
free meal and so on.
On top of that, the person who is treating

131
00:08:35,092 --> 00:08:39,113
for the free meal paying, feels good now.
They're not just paying for their meal,

132
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,750
they're treating the other person, that's
another benefit.

133
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:47,228
But the other thing to realize, the pain
of paying, the amount of psychological

134
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:51,658
agony we get from parting with our money
is not a linear its not.

135
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:56,718
It's not increasing at the same rate as
the amount of money is increasing.

136
00:08:56,718 --> 00:09:02,894
So paying, let's say $10, is much worse
than paying 0.

137
00:09:02,894 --> 00:09:06,380
But paying 20 is not much worse than
paying 10, it's a little worse but not

138
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,110
much.
And paying 40 is not twice as bad as

139
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,935
paying 20.
So the relationship between how much

140
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:16,680
you're paying and the pain of paying has
the same diminishing return, pattern we've

141
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,314
talked about before.
And because of that, if you take a bill,

142
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:25,445
you split it to two people, both people
have the agony of, let's say, paying $20.

143
00:09:25,445 --> 00:09:31,590
But if one person gets to pay $40, they
don't get double that agony.

144
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,134
So in some it's always a good deal to
alternate, not always, but in most cases,

145
00:09:36,134 --> 00:09:41,156
it's a good deal to alternate.
Somebody get the meal the meal for free,

146
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:46,978
the other person feels that their treating
and the accumulation of the pain of paying

147
00:09:46,978 --> 00:09:50,683
is not, eh, is not doubling, it's actually
good deal.
