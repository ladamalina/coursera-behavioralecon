1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:07,050
another kind of eh, close or distance
relative to the pain of paying, is called

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,450
mental accounting.
And here's the idea of mental accounting.

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,126
You know, sometimes companies have
multiple departments, and what they do is,

4
00:00:18,126 --> 00:00:22,822
they once a year they assign money to the
different departments.

5
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:27,319
And the money after it's assigned is
non-fungible, they can't switch it between

6
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:30,357
them.
And if one department runs out of money,

7
00:00:30,357 --> 00:00:32,912
too bad.
If a department has too much money, you

8
00:00:32,912 --> 00:00:36,080
know, they make a big party where
everybody gets a new laptop.

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,488
But the idea is that once money is
assigned to categories, money is not

10
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:44,820
fungible, and the idea of mental
accounting is that we as individual

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,684
consumers also work a little bit like the
accountant, that we assign money to

12
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:54,479
different categories and we spend money
according to these categories.

13
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,614
So here's a beautful example that Dick
Taylor gives.

14
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:03,930
And the example is the following.
Eh, you bought a ticket for the theater.

15
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,607
It cost you a $100.
You get to the theater, you open your

16
00:01:07,607 --> 00:01:12,070
wallet and to your horror you discover
that you lost the ticket.

17
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,367
Luckily you have another $100 bill so you
can buy another ticket.

18
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:18,824
Would you buy another ticket?
When people are aksed this question most

19
00:01:18,824 --> 00:01:20,572
of them say no, I'm not going to buy
anohter ticket.

20
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:22,579
I lost the ticket, too bad.
I'm not buying another ticket.

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,505
But what if you bought another ticket?
How much would you feel, then, the theater

22
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,516
cost you?
Most people say $200, the first ticket

23
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:33,154
plus the second ticket.
That's case 1.

24
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:37,030
Case 2, you haven't bought a ticket yet.
You're going to the theater.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,360
You're going to buy a ticket.
You open your wallet.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,104
And to your horror, you discover that you
lost a 100 dollar bill.

27
00:01:43,105 --> 00:01:46,096
What happens now?
Do you say to yourself, oh, I lost a

28
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,567
hundred dollar bill, let's not go to the
opera.

29
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:52,672
Most people say, how is this related?
I lost a hundred dollar bill, why in God's

30
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:56,910
name would I not go to the theater now?
And then, and then they go ahead and they

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:00,140
spend their hundred dollars and get a
ticket to the theater.

32
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,970
And then how much do you feel that the
tickets cost you?

33
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:06,029
A hundred dollars.
Now think about both of these cases.

34
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,537
In both of them, you lost a piece of paper
worth a hundred dollars.

35
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,580
Once it was called a ticket, once it was
called a hundred dollars, but how it was

36
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,937
called makes you feel very different,
right?

37
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:21,545
Now think back about the accounting story,
if you assigned money to the entertainment

38
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:26,079
department you gave them $100 and the
entertainment department bought a ticket.

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,480
And then also take it you say too bad to
the entertainment department.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,190
I'm not replenishing you.
But if you lost money from your general

41
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,310
wallet, you don't feel any need to for the
entertainment department to pay for it.

42
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,567
Say, I lost $100, why should the
entertainment department suffer for it.

43
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:46,345
Here's a $100, go and buy a ticket.
So there are a couple of things

44
00:02:46,345 --> 00:02:49,146
interesting here.
One is that as we assign money to

45
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:54,787
different categories, this assignment
controls how we feel about the money.

46
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:59,024
And the second thing is that money that we
haven't assigned, money that is in our

47
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:02,265
general wallet category, feels very, very
differently.

48
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:07,367
Another way to think about his is what
happens when you get money back.

49
00:03:07,368 --> 00:03:12,141
What happen if you get some money back
that is only assigned to one category like

50
00:03:12,141 --> 00:03:15,604
a gift certificate or off to something
like a return policy.

51
00:03:15,604 --> 00:03:20,367
And all of sudden because it's assigned to
one category, it's easy for us To spend

52
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,110
it, we don't, it's assigned to that
category.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:29,776
And here's another example for this.
Image that you got paid $5000 dollars to

54
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,540
do a workshop somewhere.
And you did it in one of two ways.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,130
The money was either deposited in your
checking account six months ago and now

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:43,097
you show up in Japan and you have this
Workshop to give.

57
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:48,938
In the second case, they give you the
money cash in Japanese yen as you get to

58
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,890
the hotel in Japan.
Now Japan is expensive.

59
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:56,899
Everything is expensive, travel, food,
drinks, entertainment, and so on.

60
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,870
In which of those cases would you have an
easier time to spend the money.

61
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,280
In the first case, which was in your
checking account, it's already a part of

62
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,900
your checking account it's a part of your
wealth and now you would feel bad about

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,876
spending it.
In the second case where you have all this

64
00:04:12,876 --> 00:04:16,972
amount of money and it's connected to your
trip it's easier for you to spend it

65
00:04:16,972 --> 00:04:22,186
because it's more of a.
Connected in the same mental category as

66
00:04:22,186 --> 00:04:25,664
your trip, easier to go ahead and spend
it.

67
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:31,673
Now you can also see why a, this notion of
mental accounting is kind of connected to,

68
00:04:31,673 --> 00:04:36,708
eh, the pain of paying, and how to either
distance or a close cousins.

69
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,260
Mental accounting, by the way, is also why
we see all kind of strange things in the

70
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,729
marketplace.
Why we see, for example, leave money in a

71
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:50,430
low-bearing, checking account with very
low interest on one hand.

72
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,186
On the other hand have high-interest
credit card loans or car payment loans.

73
00:04:55,187 --> 00:04:58,900
And we ask people about it they feel like
these are 2, 2 separate domains.

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,476
These are savings and this is spending,
and you don't differentiate the 2.

75
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:08,640
And if you think about all of these
notions of separating money into different

76
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,950
accounts and spending according to, these
separations.

77
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:16,022
It means money in our mind is not
perfectly fungible.

78
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:19,936
Money have budgets and depending on our
budget allocation to the different

79
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:24,332
categories that will depend our spending.
Now mostly when we think about mental

80
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:27,732
accounting we think about as a mistake in
decision making.

81
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:31,336
After all one of the main benefits of
money is that is fungible.

82
00:05:31,336 --> 00:05:36,064
You can switch it from place to place but
people don't treat it as fungible.

83
00:05:36,064 --> 00:05:41,404
But I would like to argue that mentally
counting is actually a good strategy given

84
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:45,082
our inability.
So, what are we asking people to do in

85
00:05:45,082 --> 00:05:48,070
reality?
We're asking them to think about every

86
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,517
purchase, how it could translate to all
other purchases.

87
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,970
If I buy coffee today, what would I not be
able to do?

88
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,430
If I buy a car today, what I would not be
able to do across all categories.

89
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,929
Turns out, they're just too difficult to
do.

90
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,380
So what are people doing?
We are restricting ourselves, and we're

91
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,605
saying, okay this is probably not going to
be ideal, but I'm going to think only

92
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:11,268
about this bucket.
I'm going to assign money to this bucket

93
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:16,458
of, you know, let's call it dinners or
entertainment or shopping, clothing.

94
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,570
Vacations, and I'm just going to think
about it in this, in this bucket.

95
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,520
Is it optimal?
Of course not.

96
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,825
Is it leading to mistakes?
Of course, yes.

97
00:06:24,826 --> 00:06:27,710
But nevertheless it's constraining the
problem.

98
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,126
It's creating boundaries for it that are
much more clear and therefore allowing us

99
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:35,304
to work better.
So if we were all perfectly rational,

100
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:39,070
perfectly rational.
Then mental accounting would not make

101
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,747
sense.
But given how difficult it is for us to

102
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:46,906
think about money mental accounting does
help us to partition the problem and at

103
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:50,913
least get one step ahead.
Now, if we're going to create solutions

104
00:06:50,913 --> 00:06:55,315
for people if we're going to create new
digitized bank accounts and we tell

105
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:59,252
people, think better about money.
You can have two approaches.

106
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:03,460
You could say, let's create something that
assumes perfect rationality, and let's

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,180
help people think about perfect
fungibility and how to move money between

108
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,480
accounts and what's the right thing to do.
That's one approach.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,660
The second approach is to say People are
already adopting this approach of mentally

110
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,330
counting, maybe it's naturally a good way
for people think about money.

111
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:25,148
And even if it's not optimal, and maybe
what we could do is we could captialize on

112
00:07:25,148 --> 00:07:29,674
this ill built And approach for
partitioning money, and let's help people

113
00:07:29,674 --> 00:07:32,627
do that better.
So if I think if you think about those two

114
00:07:32,627 --> 00:07:35,550
approaches.
It's kind of how we are trying to help

115
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,806
people think better.
Are we trying to get people to think all

116
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:43,026
the way to level of perfect rationality.
Or are we taking something that is kind of

117
00:07:43,026 --> 00:07:45,854
half way into it.
We're taking something that people are

118
00:07:45,854 --> 00:07:48,784
doing, that is kind of the shortcut that
we already have.

119
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:52,147
To think about laughing, just trying to
optimize that.

120
00:07:52,148 --> 00:07:55,582
From the two types of solutions, I
generally more believe in the, in the

121
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:58,365
second one.
I believe that our, we have a better

122
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:03,465
chance of succeeding by taking some
natural tendency of processing information

123
00:08:03,465 --> 00:08:08,790
and building on that, rather than assuming
it doesn't exist and build something that

124
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:09,583
is perfect.
