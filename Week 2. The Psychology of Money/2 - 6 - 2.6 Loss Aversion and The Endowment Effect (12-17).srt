1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:08,325
One of the most interesting findings in
behavioral economics, and definitely in

2
00:00:08,325 --> 00:00:14,580
one of the earliest finding, has been this
idea of loss of aversion.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,894
And loss of aversion is the idea that we
get happy when we make money.

4
00:00:20,894 --> 00:00:27,067
But, we really suffer when we lose money.
So, for example, ask yourself, if I flip

5
00:00:27,067 --> 00:00:32,108
the coin and you got the $150.
If it fell on tails and you lost a $100,

6
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:35,398
if it fell on heads would you take this
bet?

7
00:00:35,398 --> 00:00:38,970
The expected value is positive, but would
you take it?

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,675
Most people would say no.
And if you say yes to that one, what about

9
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:47,570
if the positive was 125 and the negative
was minus 100, will you take that?

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:52,662
At some point, most people say I would not
take it even though the expected value,

11
00:00:52,662 --> 00:00:55,791
the average of those two outcomes is
positive.

12
00:00:55,792 --> 00:01:00,181
Also, if you've invested in the stock
market, you probably realize that on days

13
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:04,521
when you make 2%, you're happy.
But on days that you lose 2%, you're

14
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:08,594
really miserable.
And this asymmetry around the neutral

15
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:13,290
point has become very important, and this
be calling Loss Aversion.

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,972
Gains make us happy, but losses make us
really miserable.

17
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:24,447
And there are all kind of consequences of
this idea of, of loss aversion.

18
00:01:24,447 --> 00:01:30,560
For example, it's important to realize
that the losses are not just around the

19
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,659
zero, it's around where you are.
So, for example, imagine that all of a

20
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,882
sudden I give you some salary.
I give you maybe $50,000 a year as a

21
00:01:39,882 --> 00:01:43,034
salary.
Once I gave you that amount of money, what

22
00:01:43,034 --> 00:01:46,419
do you think about the reduction of your
salary?

23
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,065
Are you looking at compared to zero?
No.

24
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:52,664
You look at it from this new point of
making $50,000.

25
00:01:52,664 --> 00:01:58,502
And if I try to take something away from
you, it's becoming incredibly unpleasant.

26
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:02,120
So, how might we use this idea of loss
aversion?

27
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,040
First of all, let's think about the
following example.

28
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,380
Imagine that you're working for me, you're
a sales person and you're selling TVs for

29
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,290
example.
And you're selling TV A and TVs B's.

30
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,192
And both of those companies pay
commission.

31
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:22,408
Company A pays you when you sell a TV A's,
and company B sell you gives you

32
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:28,386
commission when you sell TV B.
How could these companies get you to sell

33
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:32,360
more of their TVs?
Of course, they could increase their

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,116
commission.
If you got more commission from one TV,

35
00:02:35,116 --> 00:02:38,341
you would sell that more.
If you got more commission from the other

36
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:42,037
TV, you would sell that more.
But can we use loss aversion?

37
00:02:42,038 --> 00:02:46,227
So, imagine what would happen if one of
the companies prepaid you.

38
00:02:46,228 --> 00:02:51,322
They, they said look, we think that this
year you're going to sell 300 TVs from our

39
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:55,062
TVs and we're going to give you all the
commission up front.

40
00:02:55,062 --> 00:03:01,057
And then, every TV you don't sell that is
ours, you have to give us the money back.

41
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:05,362
So, we run many experiments like this.
And we get people to be in the position of

42
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:08,698
the salesperson.
And for one type of TV they sell, they get

43
00:03:08,698 --> 00:03:13,686
commission after the fact.
And for the other type of TV, they get the

44
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:17,544
comission in advance as if they always
sold just this TV.

45
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:22,807
And then, they can, if they don't sell the
TV, they have to give the money back.

46
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:27,394
So, imagine for example, that I am the
salesperson.

47
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:31,611
And if I sell one of the TVs, TV B, I make
$12.

48
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:34,050
But then, if I, and if I sell TV A, I make
$10.

49
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:39,072
But if TV A prepays me, it means that if I
sell, if I sell TV B I get $12 and I have

50
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:45,007
to pay back $10.
Now, it's still a good deal for me because

51
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:50,895
I get more money and have to get rid of
less, right?

52
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:55,860
If I sell TV A, I'm, I'm, I've gotten $10
and nothing happened.

53
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,570
If I sell TV B, I have to give back $10
but I actually made more money.

54
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,855
What happened in the experiment?
People oversell the TV that's prepaid.

55
00:04:05,855 --> 00:04:09,542
Even when it's irrational, even when they
lose money.

56
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:14,624
Which suggests that once you give people
money, they value that money to a higher

57
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:19,905
degree, they don't want to give it up.
And because of that, they are redirecting

58
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:22,992
their efforts.
Here's another way to think about how

59
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:26,269
these effects might work.
So, imagine you work for a company.

60
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,376
And every month you can save money in your
retirement plan.

61
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:35,290
And the way it usually works is that you
put some money in, let's say 5% of your

62
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,670
salary, and the company matches 5% of your
salary.

63
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,290
And those 5%, and 5% go into your
long-term savings account.

64
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,677
Now, what if your company actually matches
up to 10%?

65
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:51,760
If you're putting 5 and they're putting 5,
you're leaving some money on the table but

66
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,660
you don't see it being left on the table.
One of the things that we predict would

67
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,703
happen is the following.
What if the company gave 10% up front and

68
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:05,224
then you matched it?
But you only put 5%.

69
00:05:05,224 --> 00:05:09,942
And then, they take those other 5% that
you did not match, and they take it back.

70
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,561
Now, we have the principal of loss
aversion working, right?

71
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:17,523
Now, you see money going into your
long-term savings.

72
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:21,290
You see that you are not matching all of
it, and you see some of it going away.

73
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,524
And the idea is that money that we don't
get, it's a shame.

74
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:29,240
But money that goes away have a lot of
psychological impact.

75
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,136
And because of the prediction is that
under those conditions, people would save

76
00:05:35,136 --> 00:05:38,116
more money.
There's another implication for loss

77
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:42,743
aversion which is very interesting, which
is something called the endowment effect.

78
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:47,549
And again, the idea is once we get
something, we get used to owning it.

79
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,202
And from that starting point, we think
about gaining from that perspective, or

80
00:05:52,202 --> 00:05:56,408
losing from that perspective.
But we've adjusted to this new level of

81
00:05:56,408 --> 00:05:59,230
ownership, right?
We get the salary, we get the house.

82
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,130
Whatever it is.
The initial experiments on the endowment

83
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,190
effect were done with mugs.
They took a big group of students.

84
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,377
They gave half of them mugs and they gave
half of them candy.

85
00:06:11,378 --> 00:06:17,022
And then they said, look, the people who
have the mugs, how much would you sell

86
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:20,010
your mug for?
And then they told them, and how much

87
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:23,350
would you pay for candy?
And the people who had the candy, the

88
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:26,062
chocolate bar, they say, how much would
you sell?

89
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:29,170
You can be, bar four, and how much would
you buy a mug for?

90
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:33,726
Now, because you assigned the mugs and the
candies randomly, 50% of the people got

91
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:38,198
those, 50% of the people got those.
You would expect that for 50%, they would

92
00:06:38,198 --> 00:06:41,769
prefer the other good.
But what happens when you do it?

93
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,579
Almost nobody switches.
The people who owned mugs say, oh my

94
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,927
goodness, mugs are wonderful.
I don't want to give them up.

95
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,467
Let me keep them.
I'm not willing to give them up.

96
00:06:52,468 --> 00:06:56,080
People who owned the candy bars say, oh,
candy bars are just fantastic.

97
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,691
I'm not willing to give up the candy.
So, what happen is the moment you give

98
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:04,800
people mugs, they get used to mugs.
They think mugs are great.

99
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,297
And they want a high price for giving up
these mugs.

100
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:11,520
The people who get candy, all of a sudden,
want a high price for candy.

101
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,379
And because of that, there's no switching
in this marketplace.

102
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,671
We did these experiments with Duke
basketball tickets.

103
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:23,260
I teach at Duke.
At Duke, there's a huge basketball team.

104
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,047
It's really important for the students.
It's something very central.

105
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:30,271
And toward the end of the season, if the
team is doing very well, there's some

106
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:34,426
really important games.
And the students are camping in order to

107
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:37,963
get tickets for these games.
But in that particular year, there were

108
00:07:37,963 --> 00:07:40,642
not going to be enough tickets for all the
students.

109
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:43,820
So, the students camped out in order to be
in line for the tickets.

110
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:47,288
They camped for many days.
And at the end of those many days, they

111
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:49,828
had a lottery.
And they said, well, all of you camped,

112
00:07:49,828 --> 00:07:52,962
all of you deserve tickets.
But, we don't have tickets for all of you.

113
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:57,395
So, we're going to have a lottery and some
of you are going to get the tickets and

114
00:07:57,395 --> 00:08:00,650
some of you are not.
So, we had the group that all had high

115
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:05,411
interest in those tickets and they were
randomly assigned by the lottery to people

116
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:08,883
who are ticket owners and people who are
not ticket owners.

117
00:08:08,883 --> 00:08:11,656
So, together we achieve common, we called
up these people.

118
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:16,418
We found out what the lottery outcome was.
And we knew who was the ticket owner and

119
00:08:16,418 --> 00:08:21,228
who was not, and we called them up and we
said, hey, if you're a ticket owner, can

120
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:24,980
we tempt you to sell us the tickets?
And if you were not a ticket owner, we

121
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,990
said, hey, we might get a ticket for you.
How much would you pay for it?

122
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:32,386
What happened?
The people who were ticket owners wanted

123
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:36,350
about $2,000 to give up their tickets.
Lots of money.

124
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,036
The people who did not have tickets were
willing to buy one for a hundred and some

125
00:08:41,036 --> 00:08:45,210
dollars but not more than that.
What happened is the moment people became

126
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,498
ticket owners, they value it to a higher
degree, and giving it up became much more

127
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:52,909
important.
The people who did not own the ticket did

128
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,555
not value it as much.
Now, not only that.

129
00:08:55,555 --> 00:09:00,594
But when we asked them to explain their
reasons, the reasons were very different.

130
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:03,650
Now, these two people are on two sides of
the transaction.

131
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,874
They have reasons for switching to the
other side and they have reasons for

132
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:09,864
keeping where they are.
If you have a ticket, you have a reason to

133
00:09:09,864 --> 00:09:13,640
try and sell the ticket to get money, and
you have your reasons to go to the game.

134
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,174
If you don't have a ticket, you have
reasons to go to the game, and to keep the

135
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:20,920
money or not to spend the money.
But what we heard from people when we

136
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,380
asked them why, were reasons only about
their side of the transaction.

137
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:31,030
People who had this ticket said, going to
his game is going to be my defining moment

138
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,622
to do.
It's going to be incredibly important,

139
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:36,881
it's something that would be the capstone
of my experience.

140
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:39,450
I will tell my children about it and my
grandchildren about it.

141
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,710
I'll keep on remember it.
I'll think about it.

142
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:46,940
It'll be a huge part of my experience.
The people who did not have the ticket,

143
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,011
could also give us this reason.
They could say, I want to go to the game

144
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:55,555
because it will be apart of my life,
telling my children, but no, those people

145
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:59,192
thought about the money.
They said, well, I don't want to spend so

146
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:02,370
much money on a ticket.
I can go to a bar, I could see the game

147
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,859
for free, and maybe buy some drinks, and
that would actually be more interesting

148
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:10,190
for me.
So, what happens is the moment you move on

149
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,527
the ownership curve, you start to evaluate
things from that perspective.

150
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:19,390
And you think very differently about what
you're going to lose and what you're going

151
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,016
to gain.
And in that particular case, when you're

152
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:26,368
thinking about selling a ticket, you're
thinking about what you're going to give

153
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:28,520
up, the ticket.
And that's what you focus on.

154
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,308
And that's what you think about the
experiences.

155
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,500
If you have money but no ticket, what are
you thinking?

156
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,382
You're thinking about giving up the money.
You're thinking about that side of the

157
00:10:37,382 --> 00:10:40,693
transaction.
So, it seems that loss of aversion is a

158
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:45,200
very general way for us to think about
what we have and what we own.

159
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,678
And the moment you own something, you
think about your changes in terms of gains

160
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:56,073
and losses, and then losses are more
salient and prominent, and actually more

161
00:10:56,073 --> 00:11:00,308
important in our decision.
As a final thing, you can think about what

162
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:03,677
does 30 day money back guarantee basically
provide.

163
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:08,679
It basically says, yeah, look.
Why don't you buy a sofa, take it home,

164
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:12,595
see how it is, and you could always bring
it back, right?

165
00:11:12,595 --> 00:11:15,450
And from you as a consumer, it says, okay,
I have no risk.

166
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,845
I can take this sofa home, I can try it, I
can get, I can get see how it works for

167
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:22,726
me.
What you don't probably appreciate is loss

168
00:11:22,726 --> 00:11:26,767
aversion, the endowment affect.
Probably what you don't appreciate is by

169
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:33,332
the time you bring the sofa home, and you
use it for a few days, you become to like

170
00:11:33,332 --> 00:11:38,800
it to a slightly higher degree.
All of a sudden, it's yours, and giving it

171
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,126
up is more difficult.
So, while you initially value the

172
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:46,481
transaction and saying, oh, that's not a
big deal, let me just take it home and I

173
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:50,250
will evaluate how it works.
Once you take it home, you get used to it.

174
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:55,050
You change your position to think of
yourself as an owner of that sofa.

175
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,371
Now, all of a sudden, giving it up is
tougher.

176
00:11:58,372 --> 00:12:01,669
So, in summary, loss of aversion is really
interesting.

177
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:05,630
It's one of the first important findings
in behavioral economics.

178
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,487
And if you think about it, it's
everywhere.

179
00:12:07,487 --> 00:12:12,734
And you can also think about how to
introduce it in places where people could

180
00:12:12,734 --> 00:12:17,833
actually be prompted by it, like in
financial savings, to behave better.
