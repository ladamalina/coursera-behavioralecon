1
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:06,087
In this section, we're going to talk about
the psychology of money.

2
00:00:06,088 --> 00:00:09,882
There's a little joke that a group of
people is waiting at the bank to do all

3
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:14,227
kinds of transaction, get money and so on.
All of a sudden, two robbers come in.

4
00:00:14,228 --> 00:00:17,290
They point their guns.
They try to rob the bank.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,192
They do all kind of things.
Unintentially, one of them, as they move,

6
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:24,818
puts his masks out, and all of a sudden
his face is visible.

7
00:00:24,818 --> 00:00:29,654
He puts his mask back on and he turn to
the person next to him and says, did you

8
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,766
see my face?
The person says, yes.

9
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:35,798
Boom, he shoots him dead.
He turns to the next person and says, did

10
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,105
you see my face?
The person says, yes.

11
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:42,764
Shoots him dead.
He turns to a third person, a woman, and

12
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:47,790
he says, did you see my face?
And the woman says, I did not, but my

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,957
husband did.
What is the psychology of money?

14
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,647
When we think about money, money's all
about the opportunity cost.

15
00:00:55,648 --> 00:00:59,300
Every time we buy something, we buy a
sandwich, it's about what we are not going

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,096
to be able to do in the future.
If you buy one thing, the money would come

17
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:06,321
up from somewhere.
But this opportunity cost is something

18
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:10,810
that is very hard for us to envision, very
hard to, hard for us to think about, very

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:14,627
hard, for us to actually realize the
trade-off that we're making.

20
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:18,910
So instead, what do we do as human beings?
We look at all kinds of shortcuts.

21
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:22,355
All kinds of other things that we could do
with money, to make us feel that we're

22
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:26,250
making the right decision.
This is why we do things, like we care

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,016
about the method of payment that we're
using.

24
00:01:29,016 --> 00:01:32,770
We look at relativity.
We look at relative prices.

25
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,326
We do all kinds of other things that are
not perfectly rational, but at least makes

26
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:40,279
us feel that we're making the right
decision.

27
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,854
And my hope is that, by the end of this
section, you will not just better

28
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:49,745
understand the psychology of money, you
might actually be able to make slightly

29
00:01:49,745 --> 00:02:21,346
better decisions with your own money.
Hi.

30
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:26,080
Today, I want to talk a little bit about
the psychology of money.

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,847
Now, this might seem strange, because
after all, we use money all the time.

32
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:34,144
We use it day in and day out, over time,
lots of kind of payments, cash, credit

33
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:37,012
cards and so on.
And because we use it so much, we might

34
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:40,940
think we're experts in using money.
But I want us to question this.

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,000
I want us to go back a little bit, and I
want us to ask, are we really, do we

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,240
really understand how money works?
Do we really kind of figure out how it

37
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,720
works, what kinds of tricks it has, how we
use it, how it influences what we're

38
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,360
willing to do?
But before we say some bad things about

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,104
money, my mother always told me that it's
always nice to say something good.

40
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:03,210
To start with, so let's talk about some
good things.

41
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,765
So, money is an incredible invention.
Just think to yourself how the world would

42
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:12,147
look like without money.
We would probably have to do barters all

43
00:03:12,147 --> 00:03:15,417
the time.
We might grow broccoli and somebody else

44
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:20,592
might raise chickens and we would have to
take our broccoli and go to the chicken

45
00:03:20,592 --> 00:03:23,810
farmer and try to trade.
How much broccoli for how much chicken?

46
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:26,722
Do you they want some broccoli today or
not?

47
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:32,652
The world would be incredibly difficult if
we had to do barters on a domain by domain

48
00:03:32,652 --> 00:03:37,236
in domain by domain abil, way.
Now, what does money do?

49
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:42,660
Money creates a central mechanism that
everything could be traded of.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,220
We can trade broccoli for money, and then
money for chicken, and so on and so forth.

51
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,120
So now, we don't need to worry about all
of those exchanges.

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,877
We can just do one exchange with money.
So, from that perspective, it's amazing to

53
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:59,500
think about what an invention money has
been, and how it helps the market operate

54
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,110
in a much more efficient and wonderful
way.

55
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,044
I think it's a, at the level of the wheel.
Like it's a, such an important invention

56
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:09,882
for society.
Okay, so now that we've said something

57
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:14,284
good about money, let's start examining
the bad side about mar, money and the, all

58
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:19,208
kind of the challenges that we have.
So psychologically, what is money about

59
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:25,005
and how should we think about money?
Well, money's all about opportunity cost.

60
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:30,771
Every time you spend $2.50 on a cup of
coffee, what should you be thinking to

61
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:34,387
yourself?
You should be thinking about what else

62
00:04:34,387 --> 00:04:39,190
could you have done instead.
Where is this money coming from?

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,773
Would it have been best spent on a cup of
tea today and a cookie tomorrow?

64
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:49,850
So when the tea and cookie sum the same
amount, should you save it for a long time

65
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,842
and go to the movies in 15 years or maybe
buy a slightly different stereo in, 35

66
00:04:54,842 --> 00:04:58,155
years from now?
Every time you're buying something, it's

67
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:02,187
about what are you giving up, and what
else could you do if you did not take this

68
00:05:02,187 --> 00:05:05,114
action.
And of course, thinking about money this

69
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:08,794
way is incredibly difficult.
You can ask yourself, when was the last

70
00:05:08,794 --> 00:05:12,729
time that you thought about opportunity
cost, that you made those trade-offs?

71
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,537
In fact, we went to a Toyota dealership a
few years ago.

72
00:05:17,538 --> 00:05:21,660
We went to a dealership and we got people
who were just about to buy a new car.

73
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,010
And we said, please tell us, what are you
giving up?

74
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,014
If you go ahead and buy this car, what
would you not be able to do?

75
00:05:30,015 --> 00:05:32,175
And people gave us no answer.
Why?

76
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:35,437
Because nobody thought about it.
They kind of, stumped them.

77
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:38,140
You know, what, what do you mean something
would, would give up?

78
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,505
But then, we insisted.
We said, hey, something we'll have to give

79
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:43,677
up.
What are you going to give up?

80
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:47,915
And the most people would, would give us,
the most they told us is that they buy a

81
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:52,330
Toyota, they can't buy a Honda.
Which means that they made a substitution

82
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,469
in the same time frame in the same
category.

83
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,271
Now, what people should have said is that,
this amount is equivalent to what I would

84
00:06:01,271 --> 00:06:06,406
have to give up by two weeks of vacation
for the next four years, and 700 lattes,

85
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:09,795
and 37 books.
Something like that, which is across time

86
00:06:09,795 --> 00:06:13,906
and across many categories.
But the fact is, it's incredibly hard to

87
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,692
work this way.
So, we don't.

88
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:21,156
Now, there's another thing to think about
money, which is the way that we have money

89
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:24,990
functioning in our environment makes it
more difficult.

90
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:29,623
So imagine, for example, that we I was in
charge of your finances and every week I

91
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,978
would give you an envelope with cash, and
this was the cash that you had to spend

92
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:39,704
during that week and you had nothing else.
What will happen in the beginning of the

93
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:43,204
week?
You would feel that you could pay for a

94
00:06:43,204 --> 00:06:46,947
cab and buy a sandwich, and get beer, and
get a new shirt.

95
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:51,650
But as the money, as the amount went down
and down and down, you would realize your

96
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:55,344
trade-offs to a higher degree.
You would say, if I buy this, I can't buy

97
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:58,078
that.
And the trade-off would become that much

98
00:06:58,078 --> 00:07:00,520
more clear.
Now, that would work out if I gave you

99
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,080
money for a week.
And it would only probably really kick in,

100
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,770
in the last few days.
What if I gave you money for the whole

101
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,065
year?
Now, it would be really difficult to think

102
00:07:09,065 --> 00:07:11,590
about this.
But, what if the world looks like the

103
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,360
current economy in which I gave you credit
cards?

104
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,680
And I made, I gave you student loans and
mortgages and car payments.

105
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,510
And now, in that environment, what would
have been the horizon of your pain?

106
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,109
You see, if you get an envelope with a
fixed amount of money, that's your

107
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:29,990
horizon.
It's easy to see the cost and benefit.

108
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,670
It's easy to see the trade-off that you're
making.

109
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,695
But if you don't have a clear horizon,
it's saving for a retirement not really

110
00:07:36,695 --> 00:07:41,345
clear how long I would live, I have all
these student loans, and I have these

111
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:45,100
mortgage.
The horizon is so unclear, the trade-offs

112
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,196
that we're making are less clear.
So, the point is that we are supposed to

113
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:54,620
be thinking about money in a, a, a
trade-off analysis.

114
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,520
We're supposed to think about the
opportunity cost, or what sometimes called

115
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,202
the shadow value of price, the shadow
value of money.

116
00:08:01,202 --> 00:08:06,220
But, it's hard to do anyway.
And the financial environment that we've

117
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,974
created makes it even harder to think this
way.

118
00:08:08,974 --> 00:08:13,468
So, what do we know in general when people
face a problem that is too difficult to

119
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:16,467
compute, too difficult to figure out the
right way?

120
00:08:16,468 --> 00:08:20,840
We take some shortcuts.
We figure out other ways to do it, not the

121
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,836
right ways but at least some, some ways.
And this is what I want to talk about.

122
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:31,930
And this cartoon clearly indicates the
idea of opportunity cost.

123
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,370
Not in the domain of money, but in another
domain.

124
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,396
It says, we found, we really missed going
to the theater and eating in nice

125
00:08:38,396 --> 00:08:43,020
restaurants, so we gave our kids away.
Because kids are the ultimate opportunity

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,035
cost.
You get kids, there's lots and lots of

127
00:08:45,035 --> 00:08:48,108
things you can't do.
But even with kids, many people don't

128
00:08:48,108 --> 00:08:51,487
think about it up front about what they're
going to give up.

129
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:56,468
Here is one experiment that very elegantly
illustrates this problem that we have with

130
00:08:56,468 --> 00:09:00,080
thinking about opportunity cost.
So, imagine that you gave it, you were

131
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,737
given a choice.
And you said would you prerfer to buy a

132
00:09:03,737 --> 00:09:08,470
Sony stereo system for $700 or a Pioneer
system for $1000.

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,716
And basically, what you are being asked in
this question is, how do you value of the

134
00:09:13,716 --> 00:09:18,922
quality of the two stereos compared to the
saving the financial savings of $300?

135
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:25,460
How much is the Pioneer better than the
Sony, and how useful is the $300 for you?

136
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,217
That's one setup.
And in that particular setup, lots and

137
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:34,730
lots of people choose the Pioneer system.
In the second set up, it was given in a

138
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:39,316
slightly different way.
It says, would you like to pay a $1,000

139
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:43,397
for this Sony stereo or a $1,000 for the
Pioneer stereo?

140
00:09:43,397 --> 00:09:49,572
But if you pay a $1,000 dollars for the
Sony stereo, you also get $300 to spend on

141
00:09:49,572 --> 00:09:51,810
CDs and DVDs.
Now, think about it.

142
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,006
This second phrasing.
You take the same $300 you had before when

143
00:09:56,006 --> 00:10:00,943
you only spent $700 on this Sony station,
on this Sony, stereo.

144
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:05,315
But now, this $300 goes only for CDs and
DVDs.

145
00:10:05,316 --> 00:10:10,607
From the rational perspective, the second
case is less appealing.

146
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:15,636
Because the Sony includes $300 you can
only spend on CDs and DVDs, when the first

147
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:20,417
case, you could have taken this $300 and
spend it on anything else you want.

148
00:10:20,418 --> 00:10:23,866
But what happens?
Now the Sony Studio looks even more

149
00:10:23,866 --> 00:10:27,154
appealing than the previous case.
Why is it?

150
00:10:27,155 --> 00:10:32,504
It's because when you think about the
representation of $300, right?

151
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:37,910
Sony for $700 plus $300.
This representation doesn't include a lot.

152
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,455
It's a general fuzzy topic.
What exactly am I getting with $300?

153
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:45,466
But, in fact, what you could do is you
could take this $300.

154
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,418
And you could make them concrete in one
domain.

155
00:10:48,418 --> 00:10:53,524
And while, generally, they'll be worthless
than more now that you have one domain,

156
00:10:53,524 --> 00:10:58,630
you can think about them in more concrete
way, and you can actually get more excited

157
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,310
about it.
I'll give you one more example of this.

158
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,660
Can you imagine that you like coffee?
I assume most of you like coffee.

159
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,453
And let's say that they, the price for a
cappuccino is $3.

160
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:16,356
Can you imagine that I could get you to do
something for me, for a cappuccino, that

161
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:21,364
you would not be willing to do for $3?
And if that's the case, and many people

162
00:11:21,364 --> 00:11:26,332
report that this is the case, that means
that the representation of the cappuccino

163
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:30,232
is somehow worth more in your mind than
the preservation of $3.

164
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:34,796
Even though you could take the $3 and buy
a cappuccino or you could buy all kinds of

165
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:39,420
other things, the representation, the
hedonic value, the emotional appeal that

166
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,462
we have from a cappuccino is higher than
the emotional appeal for $3.

167
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:48,570
So what this, going back to the Sony and
the Pioneer example, what this suggests is

168
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,486
that we just have money in the equation.
It's not as valuable because it's about

169
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:55,440
opportunity cost.
It's general.

170
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,296
We don't know how to think about it.
And because of that, we could take that

171
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:04,444
amount of money, make it specific, make it
concrete, make it less valuable from

172
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:08,810
economic perspective.
But nevertheless, have a higher perceived

173
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,811
value for it.
And with that, change how people make

174
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,854
decisions.
