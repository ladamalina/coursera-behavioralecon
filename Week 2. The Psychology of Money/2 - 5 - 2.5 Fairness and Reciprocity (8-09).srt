1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:06,180
some time ago I met a locksmith who lives
not too far from me in Durham.

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,015
And he told me the following story.
He said that when he as just practicing

3
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:18,600
locksmith, he was not very good.
He said it would take him a long time to

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,930
get into people's locks.
And often because he was not that good, he

5
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,060
also had to break the lock.
So after a long time of trying to figure

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,880
weather if you would break the lock, then
he would replace it.

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,365
And he charged people for the standard fee
of opening the door, he would charge them

8
00:00:33,365 --> 00:00:37,199
for the lock, and people had paid him
happily and gave him a tip.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,260
He said after two years, he got really
good at it.

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,352
And now that he's really good, it takes
him minutes to open a lock, he said he

11
00:00:44,352 --> 00:00:47,230
never breaks it.
So he charges people less, just a standard

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:50,543
fee for opening a door.
And now he says, nobody gives him a tip

13
00:00:50,543 --> 00:00:54,637
anymore, and everybody argues with him.
Now, here's a situation.

14
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,150
Which one would you prefer from a utility
perspective?

15
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,539
Which situation would you prefer?
When somebody takes an hour to open your

16
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:05,172
door, or when somebody takes two minutes?
Of course the two minutes is better,

17
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:09,048
because if it's two minutes you only have
to stand outside for two minutes, you're

18
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:11,648
in your house.
If somebody goes away you don't have to

19
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:15,043
worry.
But how would you feel about paying that

20
00:01:15,043 --> 00:01:17,470
person.
If you see somebody struggling, and

21
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,541
working and sweating outside of your house
for an hour, you'll probably feel much,

22
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:24,612
much better about paying them more and
even giving them a tip.

23
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:28,139
There's this mediocre joke that says that
somebody who drives a car to the mechanic

24
00:01:28,139 --> 00:01:31,250
and he said oh you know my car is not
running very well, there's a noise from

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,674
the engine, I'm not sure what it is?
So the mechanic says open the hood, the

26
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:40,066
person opens the hood, the mechanic looks
at it, takes a hammer, bangs on a

27
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,962
particular pipe, voom, the car is driving
perfectly, the noise is, is gone and the

28
00:01:44,962 --> 00:01:50,324
mechanic said, that would be a $100.
The person says a $100 for banging with a

29
00:01:50,324 --> 00:01:54,629
hammer on a, on a pipe?
And the mechanic said, no, no, no, the

30
00:01:54,629 --> 00:02:00,643
banging is $1 knowing where to bang is $99
Now, that's not the really funny joke.

31
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:04,340
But, the idea is, that it's hard for us to
pay for expertise.

32
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,401
Right?
Somebody could be an incredibly good

33
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:11,070
locksmith, but we just don't feel good
about paying for that expertise.

34
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,614
But if we somebody sweating and working
for a long time, all of a sudden we feel

35
00:02:15,614 --> 00:02:19,380
better about the whole thing.
We did a couple of experiments on this

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,325
topic.
And one of them, we asked people how much

37
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:26,311
they would pay us to recover information
from their hard drive.

38
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:31,319
And, we asked them to think about losing
one day of information, one week of

39
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,610
information, two weeks, four weeks,ah,
three months, six months, a year of data.

40
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:40,180
So, lots of different amounts of data they
lost.

41
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,754
And you know what?
People in general were willing to play

42
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:45,390
more money for more data recovery.
That's good news.

43
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,857
But you know what people really cared
about?

44
00:02:47,858 --> 00:02:52,135
Was how long the technician worked on it.
If the technician worked for five minutes

45
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:55,070
to recover the data, they were not willing
to pay so much.

46
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,247
If the technician was working for a day,
much more, for a week, Much more.

47
00:02:59,248 --> 00:03:02,900
So, in a sense what we're doing is we're
paying for incompetence.

48
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,480
The longer people take to work on
something, the more we feel we're willing

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,165
to pay for them.
And when somebody's high skilled and we

50
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:15,209
don't see it, we're not willing to pay for
this.

51
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,699
By the way fairness is also the big
problem with the internet.

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,767
Think about big organization the New York
Times.

53
00:03:22,768 --> 00:03:27,310
What, what do we think is fair to pay.
Do we know anything about he size, of

54
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,040
course not.
Or, think about something else.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,328
In the old days when you use to come to a
teller, and you would write a check, and

56
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:38,050
they would give you cash.
You saw somebody, you're willing to pay

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,450
for this privilege.
You saw that there was a person across the

58
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,870
window from you.
You saw that they were doing something.

59
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,117
You were doing something.
You took some of their time.

60
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,480
It was perfectly okay to pay them for
their time.

61
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,454
But now it's an ATM.
You just put your card in and money comes

62
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:56,482
out.
You don't see that you cost anybody

63
00:03:56,482 --> 00:04:01,038
anything, and because of that people feel
really outraged by having to pay these

64
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:04,271
fees.
Now, what this also tells us is that

65
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:09,717
fairness in many ways is about marginal
cost, not about fixed cost.

66
00:04:09,718 --> 00:04:14,905
If an organization paid lots of money to
create something and now every additional

67
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:19,330
unit of delivery is free, as we think
about in the internet We don't feel

68
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,550
fairness needs to pay for it.
But if the fixed cost is low and all of

69
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:28,264
the cost is marginal cost, now we think
there's a need for us to pay for it.

70
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:33,165
So again, imagine The New York Times.
Imagine that the technology was such that

71
00:04:33,165 --> 00:04:37,520
the investment in the infrastructure was
very low, but every time you would read

72
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,699
the newspaper you would cost The New York
Times a dollar.

73
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:45,253
Now you would feel very bad about reading
the New York Times free without paying for

74
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,665
it.
But if it's a fixed cost, they pay lots of

75
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:51,825
money to create it but the marginal cost
is zero, the notion of fairness is not

76
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:55,100
coming along at all.
So this kind of, couple of interesting

77
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,212
points here.
One Is that we do want to express to

78
00:04:58,212 --> 00:05:02,442
people the amount of hard work.
If you're the locksmith, you want to show

79
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:05,172
your hard work.
If you're the New York Times, you might

80
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:09,383
want to show people you're hard work.
If you're the mechanic, you might want to

81
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:12,925
show people their hard work.
But on top of that, there's also the

82
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:16,600
question of how much of your effort is
fixed cost and marginal cost.

83
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,054
And when fixed cost is concerned, it's
incredibly harder to get people to care.

84
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:26,690
To feel people any kind of need for
reciprocation because of fairness any need

85
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:30,937
to pay for this.
The final story I want to tell you about

86
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:36,811
fairness is the following: There was a
plan in the Coca Cola factories in Brazil

87
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:42,224
to start charging for Coke depending on
the temperature outside.

88
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:46,952
And they basically had this Coke vending
machine and it was supposed to change the

89
00:05:46,952 --> 00:05:50,740
price of Coke based on the time of the day
and the temperature outside.

90
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,562
And if you think about it, it's a perfect
mechanism.

91
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,988
Why?
Because as the temperature goes up, the

92
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:59,210
joy from Coke goes up and you should be
willing to pay more.

93
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,000
But what happened?
People were outraged.

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,760
They were so outraged that the person who
envisioned this idea had to resign, from

95
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,950
Coke.
And why were people outraged?

96
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:13,460
Because they did not see any increase in
cost as a function of the temperature.

97
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,189
Right, furnace is not about how much money
you can charge me.

98
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,823
Fairness is about the relationship between
how much something is costing you and how

99
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:25,308
much I'm willing to pay.
Costing in terms of money, in terms, in

100
00:06:25,308 --> 00:06:28,309
terms of time and so on.
And, and because of that people are

101
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:30,230
outraged.
And they had all kinds of ideas.

102
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:34,070
They said, what if when I got close to the
machine, it would scan my eyes, and it

103
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,322
will identify exactly how thirsty I am?
And it will set the cost exactly in the

104
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:42,224
way that will be a cent below my maximum
willingness to pay?

105
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:45,287
And people were outraged with that.
By the way, it's the ideal economic

106
00:06:45,287 --> 00:06:45,931
vision.
Right?

107
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:49,780
You prize people exactly like that, but
people are outraged.

108
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,987
Now imagine the following, and you can
just imagine that.

109
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:57,224
What would happen if Coke said, we're not
just charging you more because we can,

110
00:06:57,224 --> 00:07:00,930
we're charging you more, because we have
to spend more electricity.

111
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,806
It's more expensive for us as the
temperature goes up to cool The, the

112
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:09,294
vending machine to keep the cold coke in a
cold temperature and therefore we're

113
00:07:09,294 --> 00:07:12,976
paying you more for that.
Now it would not be perceived as coke is

114
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:17,260
just gauging you depending on your
temperature, it would be an argument for

115
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,984
fairness.
Basically saying these are pass through

116
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:23,624
costs, it's not us charging you.
And you know, we're all willing to pay

117
00:07:23,624 --> 00:07:26,468
that.
For example, we're willing to pay more For

118
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:30,988
some beer in the hotel that we're willing
to pay for beer in the grocery store,

119
00:07:30,988 --> 00:07:35,897
because we know hotels have higher costs.
Airlines, by the way, sometimes increase

120
00:07:35,897 --> 00:07:40,658
their prices and saying in calling these
prices, rather than price increase, they

121
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,330
call them taxes.
By the way, if you look, at different

122
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,795
airlines, you will see the different
airlines for the same route, have very

123
00:07:46,795 --> 00:07:49,760
different taxes.
Why do they have different taxes?

124
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,260
Because taxes are not considered part of
the price.

125
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,590
They're basically saying the government is
charging us that.

126
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:58,350
Of course, the government is not charging
different airlines different amounts.

127
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,111
But some airlines are taking the amount of
increase, they are calling it taxes, and

128
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:07,527
then to us as consumer, it looks like
pass-through cost and we don't blame The

129
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:11,478
airline's for it.
So if you think about fairness, the main

130
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,724
point is that when we are buying
something, we should think about what are

131
00:08:16,724 --> 00:08:20,990
we getting, and how much does it cost us.
And if something is giving us more

132
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,090
pleasure than the cost, we should buy it,
and if something is giving us less

133
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,980
pleasure than the cost, we should not buy
it.

134
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,788
The problem is it's really hard for us to
figure out what something is worthwhile,

135
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:33,431
how much pleasure it's giving us.
So we're using all kinds of other

136
00:08:33,431 --> 00:08:36,110
techniques, all kinds of other heuristics
and strategies.

137
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:40,140
Fairness is one of them.
And fairness is not asking how much

138
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:44,970
pleasure am I getting from something, it's
saying how much work and effort has gone

139
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,410
into this thing.
And if there's been more effort, I'm

140
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,200
willing to pay more for it.
And if it's less effort, I'm willing to

141
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,724
pay.
Less for it.

142
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:56,018
And depending on the industry you're in
and the industry you're going to go into,

143
00:08:56,018 --> 00:09:00,178
expressing effort is either a benefit or
it's either easy for you to do, or hard

144
00:09:00,178 --> 00:09:04,210
for you to do, it's something you should
do more, or you should try to at least

145
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,474
think about how to do.
And, so think about fairness It's an

146
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:13,636
amazing im, important idea.
And if we can only understand it better, I

147
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,427
think we could get people to make very
different decisions.

148
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,160
One other interesting story about fairness
is the following.

149
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,870
Imagine you're at the beach with friend of
yours.

150
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,524
It's wonderful day, the temperature is
great.

151
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:29,516
The ocean is fantastic, and your friend
tells you that they're going to get some

152
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:32,327
beer and do you want some.
And you say yes, I want some.

153
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:35,070
Then your friend says look, I'm going to
and get beer but I don't know how much it

154
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:37,762
will cost.
So tell me what's the maximum amount that

155
00:09:37,762 --> 00:09:40,375
you will pay.
If they'll charge more than that, I will

156
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,919
not get the beer.
If they charge less, I'll pay for it, and

157
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:45,775
then you'll give me back the money,
whatever they, they charge.

158
00:09:45,776 --> 00:09:48,870
Okay.
So now your task is to say, what is the

159
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,787
maximum amount of money you're willing to
pay for beer?

160
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:56,155
And the friend is either telling you
they're going to a hotel, of they're going

161
00:09:56,155 --> 00:09:58,030
to a grocery store.
What will happen?

162
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,858
People give a much higher amount to the
hotel than to the grocery store.

163
00:10:01,858 --> 00:10:04,300
Why?
Because the joy of drinking beer on the

164
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,230
beach changes depending of where the beer
came from?

165
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,044
Of course not.
If it were, you know there would be trucks

166
00:10:10,044 --> 00:10:14,009
of beer, or going through lobbies of
hotels just to increase the quality of the

167
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,984
beer.
The beer is the same, but what happened is

168
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:20,290
you're notion of fairness enters into the
process.

169
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,800
You're not just thinking to yourself how
much am I going to enjoy sitting on the

170
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,849
beach here and drinking beer.
You're saying also what is a fair price.

171
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:33,710
And if the bill comes from a hotel, your
fairness includes the cost of running a

172
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,265
hotel and your willingness to pay, goes up
with it.

173
00:10:37,265 --> 00:10:42,762
So, if you think about all these stories
about fairness, what they really tell us

174
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:48,256
is that our understanding of how much
we're willing to pay for something, should

175
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:53,410
in principal comes up from comes from how
much value we're getting from it.

176
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,000
We're getting more value, we should be
willing to pay more.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,280
We're getting less value, we should be
willing to pay less.

178
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,005
But the reality is, that directly
assessing how valuable something is: how

179
00:11:04,005 --> 00:11:08,730
much do we enjoy beer, how much are we
enjoying getting our doors opened, our

180
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,340
computers recovered, a Coke.
All of those things are incredibly hard,

181
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,914
so we're using shortcuts.
And one of those shortcuts Is to say how

182
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:20,688
much effort has been created for me to
consume that and if the effort is high

183
00:11:20,688 --> 00:11:24,902
willing to pay more and if the effort is
lower willing to pay less.

184
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:29,097
And it means that as consumers you
probably want to think about effort a

185
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:33,428
little less if you think of it as a
biasing tool that gets you to pay too much

186
00:11:33,428 --> 00:11:37,584
or too little based on the effort you want
to try and overcome it.

187
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:40,870
And as producer you might want to say how
do I signal effort.

188
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:45,210
How do I tell peolple how much effort went
into it because effort is the main

189
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,830
mechanism, or one of the main mechanisms
by which people are going to decide how

190
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,060
much ot pay for something.
And as we move into the internet economy,

191
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,800
effort is harder and harder to think
about.

192
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,140
Fairness is harder and harder to think
about it.

193
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,030
More things are becoming about high fixed
costs and low marginal costs.

194
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:07,134
Most things are hidden, we don't see what,
what goes into them.

195
00:12:07,134 --> 00:12:11,808
How, how many hours go into creating a
piece of software, for example, or an app.

196
00:12:11,808 --> 00:12:20,864
And, and all of this creating new
challenges for effort, the expression of

197
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:29,723
effort because of that fairness and
because of that willingness to pay.
