1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,340
My name is Kathleen Vohs. 
I am a professor at the University of 

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,56
Minnesota. 
I'm a social psychologist who works in 

3
00:00:12,56 --> 00:00:15,270
the business school. 
I work in the marketing department. 

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,175
And today, my lecture will be on the 
topic of heterosexual, sexual 

5
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:23,598
relationships. 
So, imagine that you sat down one morning 

6
00:00:23,598 --> 00:00:28,334
to breakfast and you opened up your 
newspaper or you clicked on your favorite 

7
00:00:28,334 --> 00:00:33,444
news browser. 
And you read that officials in the UK let 

8
00:00:33,444 --> 00:00:38,772
a group of foreigners settle without 
proper emigration checks. 

9
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:43,128
Okay, now imagine further that you read 
that the group of foreigners was a group 

10
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:49,290
of women, and even further, that this was 
a group of highly attractive women. 

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,700
The story ended by noting that there may 
or may not have been sex between the 

12
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,990
immigration officers and the foreign 
women. 

13
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:04,10
Now, a few days later, you read in the 
newspaper something again about sex. 

14
00:01:04,10 --> 00:01:08,630
In this case, it's a Vianese shopping 
mall and they're offering women a special 

15
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:12,520
promotion. 
Women who agree, not just agree, but 

16
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,135
women who come to their shopping mall 
topless receive a bottle of champagne, a 

17
00:01:17,135 --> 00:01:22,200
free meal and a shopping voucher worth 40 
Euros. 

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,550
This campaign was a huge success, by the 
way. 

19
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:29,262
And very last, imagine back to your 
history days when you learned that 

20
00:01:29,262 --> 00:01:34,68
Australia was a penal colony. 
So, back then, this was in the 1800s, the 

21
00:01:34,68 --> 00:01:39,740
severest punishment for infractions was 
to have a public whipping. 

22
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,470
Now, female prisoners were given an 
option that male prisoners were not. 

23
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,704
Their whippings would be cut in half if 
they agreed to take them naked, 

24
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:54,910
presumably to please the male onlookers. 
What do these stories have in common? 

25
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:59,596
They have in common, the idea that sex is 
something that women have and, and seem 

26
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:04,796
to own or posses, in a sense. 
And that men are willing to trade 

27
00:02:04,796 --> 00:02:09,340
resources to obtain that sex in some way, 
shape or form. 

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,949
So, the resources can be living in a safe 
country, it can be money, monetary, money 

29
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:21,974
resources or it can be the lessening of a 
very, very harsh punishment. 

30
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,528
The lecture today will be about this very 
idea, that sex is a female resource and 

31
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:30,686
that men are willing to trade resources 
that they posses or have access to in 

32
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:37,575
order to gain sexual access to women. 
It is called sexual economics. 

33
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:41,535
And it's probably the most unromantic 
theory about sex you'll ever have 

34
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:45,322
learned. 
But in it we're able to describe and 

35
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:52,216
predict people's behaviors on the basis 
of fundamental basic economic principles. 

36
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:56,580
So, let me tell you a little bit more 
about the core ideas. 

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,927
The core ideas of sexual economic series 
are that countries, cultures, and 

38
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:06,640
individuals treat female sexuality as if 
it has value and is precious. 

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,340
Male sexuality however, has no value or 
worth. 

40
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,633
Women own sex, that is, it is theirs to 
decide when sex occurs, with whom, why, 

41
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:22,972
and how. 
And men, conversely enter into a sexual 

42
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:28,994
interaction with other resources. 
And they're seeking to trade them with 

43
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:33,300
women for access to them, sexually. 
Now, these resources can be monetary. 

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,90
But they can also be things like rights, 
like voting rights or land. 

45
00:03:38,90 --> 00:03:43,210
It can be emotional, such as caring and 
being kind to them or affectionate. 

46
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:47,96
And they could be relationship oriented 
resources as well, such as commitment, 

47
00:03:47,96 --> 00:03:50,460
devotion, marriage and last, even 
children, the agreement that this 

48
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:55,867
relationship can bear children. 
In the sexual economics theory, it's 

49
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:59,843
understood that a high price of sex, 
which is to say the amount or the 

50
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:04,884
costliness or the preciousness of the 
resources that men give, that the price 

51
00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:09,712
of sex when it's high, that favors women 
and men would like the price of sex to be 

52
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:16,527
low. 
So, women's goals are often to obtain 

53
00:04:16,527 --> 00:04:21,609
resources as many as possible before sex 
will commence and men's goal will be to 

54
00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:27,245
obtain sex without having to give many 
resources. 

55
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:33,130
what are we talking about when we talk 
about sex in this theory? 

56
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,750
Well, the idea of sex is broader than 
simply the act of sexual intercourse. 

57
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:42,164
Sex can be talking about sex. 
Sex can include being near an attractive 

58
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:47,268
woman or a sexual woman. 
Sex can include viewing or finding sexual 

59
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:52,475
imagery appealing. 
And this includes acts with a variety of 

60
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:57,350
sexual overtones, such as dating, 
flirting, touching, fondling and also, of 

61
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,626
course, sexual intercourse. 
So, how do we know that sex is a female 

62
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:07,955
resource? 
Well, there are several experiments that 

63
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:12,630
pinpoint this idea that women are the 
gatekeepers of sex. 

64
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,412
So, one telling study, as to men and 
women in dating relationships, at what 

65
00:05:16,412 --> 00:05:20,11
number of dates do you think it's 
appropriate for men and women to first 

66
00:05:20,11 --> 00:05:24,206
have sex? 
In case you're wondering, men, on 

67
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:29,509
average, think that the number of dates 
should be half as many as women. 

68
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,711
And then, more importantly, for this idea 
that women own sex and decide when sex 

69
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:39,239
occurs in a relationship. 
The researchers then further asked these 

70
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:43,691
men and women when in your dating 
relationships did sex take place? 

71
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,351
And what they find is that men's 
preferences or ideas about what number of 

72
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:51,311
dates sex should first take place on or 
no relationship to when they were having 

73
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:56,863
sex in their relationships. 
But women's preferences and ideas about 

74
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:00,223
when sex should first take in a 
relationship were almost perfectly 

75
00:06:00,223 --> 00:06:05,902
correlated with when men and women 
actually had sex in those relationships. 

76
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:11,966
So, this underscores, this idea that 
women are the gatekeepers of sex. 

77
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:15,630
They decide when, how, and why sex 
occurs. 

78
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,322
We come to understand the idea that women 
have more negotiating power when it comes 

79
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:24,266
to sex as stemming from a basic 
underlying difference between men and 

80
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:30,993
women's desire to have sex. 
So, in a paper that my colleagues and I 

81
00:06:30,993 --> 00:06:37,360
published in early 2000s, we investigated 
whether men or women want sex more. 

82
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,712
[LAUGH] It may not sound like a very 
interesting or surprising question, but 

83
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:45,520
in fact, the literature was quite 
divided. 

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,820
When we looked at various textbooks about 
sexuality, some of them said, well of 

85
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:54,107
course men want sex more than women. 
But others said, women want sex more than 

86
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:57,734
men. 
And still, yet, others said the question 

87
00:06:57,734 --> 00:07:02,390
should not even be asked. 
We decided to do an investigation into 

88
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,190
the science. 
We wanted to read all scientific articles 

89
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:11,86
on men and women's sexual preferences, 
emotions, ideas, beliefs, attitudes and 

90
00:07:11,86 --> 00:07:14,420
behaviors. 
And so, we did that. 

91
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,640
We read over 250 articles about men and 
women sexual desires and behaviors. 

92
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,312
And we broke the research down into 12 
different categories of indicators of 

93
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:28,827
sexual motivation. 
So, things like how frequency, how 

94
00:07:28,827 --> 00:07:34,468
frequently people have sexual fantasies? 
the desired number of sexual partners, 

95
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:38,890
the liking for a variety of sexual 
practices and the amount of masturbation 

96
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,240
that people engage in. 
And across all 12 categories, we found 

97
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,60
overwhelming evidence that men want sex 
more than women. 

98
00:07:49,60 --> 00:07:52,492
Perhaps not surprising to some, but 
again, that was an important step for us 

99
00:07:52,492 --> 00:07:55,528
in this investigation of sexual 
economics. 

100
00:07:55,528 --> 00:08:00,840
And so, when we now understand that men 
want sex more than women, we can better 

101
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,380
understand how men and women enter into a 
sexual relationship. 

102
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,950
Or rather, a relationship that may turn 
sexual. 

103
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,435
So now, understanding that on average, 
when a man and a woman come together in a 

104
00:08:14,435 --> 00:08:18,920
relationship that may turn sexual, he, on 
average, will want sex more than she 

105
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,872
does. 
This means that she has more negotiating 

106
00:08:23,872 --> 00:08:28,763
power in order to request or demand other 
types of resources before sex will take 

107
00:08:28,763 --> 00:08:33,113
place. 
There's a theory called the principle of 

108
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,422
least interest. 
And in it, it states that whenever two 

109
00:08:36,422 --> 00:08:40,266
parties come together to have a 
negotiation, the party that is interested 

110
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:44,310
in the outcome the least has the most 
power. 

111
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:47,70
So, if you've ever been in love with 
someone and you love that person more 

112
00:08:47,70 --> 00:08:49,900
than that person loves you, you've felt 
this. 

113
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,743
That you would do more things, you would 
sacrifice more than would the other 

114
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,44
person. 
And so, when men and women enter into a 

115
00:08:57,44 --> 00:09:02,510
sexual negotiation, because men, in 
general, will want sex more than women. 

116
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:08,316
Women then, can ask for other resources 
in exchange before sex will take place. 

117
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:14,460
Now, the sexual economics theory is 
backed up by a variety of research. 

118
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,750
Like in the other paper I described, we 
read over 200 scholarly articles about 

119
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,40
how men and women think about sex and 
whether we could understand sex as female 

120
00:09:23,40 --> 00:09:28,440
resource that men trade other resources 
to obtain. 

121
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,532
We reviewed scholarly research from 
anthropology, sociology, clinical 

122
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:37,234
psychology, demography, medicine, health, 
history and the like. 

123
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:38,924
And we were overwhelmed by the amount of 
evidence that we were able to obtain in 

124
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:41,72
support of a sexual economics theory. 
So, let me tell you a few pieces of 

125
00:09:41,72 --> 00:09:42,898
information and then some experiments 
that my lab conducted. 

126
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:50,17
And one piece of information that helps 
us understand sexual economics are 

127
00:09:50,17 --> 00:09:56,910
conditions in which there are 
differences, discrepancies in the number 

128
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:05,110
of men and women there are in a local 
environment. 

129
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,598
And so if we understand women as owning 
sex and men wanting sex, this is going to 

130
00:10:09,598 --> 00:10:13,888
be a very crude analogy, but because 
we're talking about an economic model, we 

131
00:10:13,888 --> 00:10:19,940
can understand women as in a sense being 
sellers. 

132
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,540
And men, in a sense, being buyers. 
So there are studies of what happens in a 

133
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:32,650
local environment when there are more 
women to men or more men, men to women. 

134
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,246
And so, in one of these studies, the 
researchers found in a historical 

135
00:10:36,246 --> 00:10:40,276
analysis of women's clothing that when 
there are many, many, many more men in a 

136
00:10:40,276 --> 00:10:44,58
local environment compared to women, this 
means that women had even more 

137
00:10:44,58 --> 00:10:49,450
negotiating power than they would 
otherwise. 

138
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:52,778
And, in the clothing analysis, they found 
that skirt lengths, women's skirt 

139
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,106
lengths, were the longest in conditions 
in which there were many more men in a 

140
00:10:56,106 --> 00:11:01,870
local environment compared to women. 
Now, the converse happened as well. 

141
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,130
In local environments across history, 
when there'd be more women in the 

142
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:12,320
environment than men, skirt lengths rose, 
so that the skirts were shorter. 

143
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,284
And we understood this in our theory as 
the way that women dress and the way that 

144
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:23,758
their skirts rise and fall might 
represent something like advertising. 

145
00:11:23,758 --> 00:11:27,726
That when women sexuality is their, 
again, this is very crude, but is their 

146
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:32,810
product then, they need to advertise 
their product in some ways. 

147
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:36,822
And wearing alluring clothing is one way 
for women to see more sexual, and that 

148
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:40,834
need would arise when women are competing 
with other women more so than when there 

149
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:46,616
are fewer women to compete with. 
So, that means the conditions in which 

150
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:50,950
there are lots of women and very few men, 
women dress more sexily. 

151
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:54,546
And when there are many more men than 
women in an environment, women didn't 

152
00:11:54,546 --> 00:11:59,109
have to dress very sexy and they kept 
their skirt lengths long. 

153
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,973
other research supports this idea that 
men and women trade sex in other types of 

154
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:06,422
resources. 
So, in one paper that asked men and 

155
00:12:06,422 --> 00:12:10,910
women, what most annoys or irritates them 
about dating relationships with the 

156
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:17,252
opposite sex, they found evidence in 
support of sexual economics theory. 

157
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:21,441
So, women reported that the most 
irritating thing about dating a man is 

158
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:27,133
when a man offers relationship promises 
before the couple has sex. 

159
00:12:27,133 --> 00:12:31,464
And once the couple has sex, he is 
nowhere to be found and the relationship 

160
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:36,560
does not ensue. 
Men have a different complaint. 

161
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,114
Men complain that when they court a woman 
for a very long time and shower her with 

162
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:45,668
gifts and dinners and other kinds of 
monetary or even affectionate resources, 

163
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:50,930
and then the relationship never turns 
sexual. 

164
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,773
So, in both of these cases we see that a 
resource was given up by one gender and 

165
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:58,799
there was an expectation that the other 
resource would come in and be traded for 

166
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,792
it, but then that expectation then was 
not met. 

167
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:08,549
These irritations about courtship also 
support the idea of sexual economics and 

168
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:14,529
sex as a female and tradeable resource. 
Now, we move to some experiments in my 

169
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:19,1
lab to try to better understand sexual 
economics. 

170
00:13:19,1 --> 00:13:23,901
And and in particular, how we can better 
understand women's reactions to, to the 

171
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:28,196
idea of sex. 
So, in these experiments, what we have 

172
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:33,22
men and women doing is we have them 
viewing sexual imagery. 

173
00:13:33,22 --> 00:13:37,329
And we use their reactions to sexual 
imagery as a proxy for how they feel 

174
00:13:37,329 --> 00:13:41,501
about sex in general. 
So, the general setup of these 

175
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:45,466
experiments is that subjects come into 
the lab and they sit down, and they view 

176
00:13:45,466 --> 00:13:51,977
a series of print advertisements. 
And the key advertisement is one for a 

177
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:55,984
watch. 
And that watch is either promoted by an 

178
00:13:55,984 --> 00:14:03,740
ad that features a highly sexual scene or 
an ad that features a non-sexual scene. 

179
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,733
In this scene we have of a picture of 
mountains, actually. 

180
00:14:07,733 --> 00:14:11,155
We have our subjects coming in and 
looking at these, and then giving us 

181
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:16,731
their spontaneous reactions to the ads. 
And we have them doing that by when 

182
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:21,730
they're viewing the ads, they rehears a 
ten digit number in their heads. 

183
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:25,300
Why do we do this? 
Because previous research has shown that 

184
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,772
when you get men and women to be 
distracted with another task, their 

185
00:14:28,772 --> 00:14:33,964
spontaneous gut reactions to the 
environment can come out more. 

186
00:14:33,964 --> 00:14:38,180
And we're interested in men and women 
spontaneous impulsive reactions to sexual 

187
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,705
imgary. 
So, in the first experiment, our subjects 

188
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:46,455
come inside a lab and they start 
rehearsing that ten digit number. 

189
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:50,680
Now, we have them looking through a 
booklet with print advertisements, one of 

190
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,710
which then shows that watch that I 
mentioned, either being advertised in a 

191
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,139
sexual scene or in a mountain-scape 
scene. 

192
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:04,314
And the part that makes this study having 
to do with sexual economics is, we then 

193
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:08,915
further vary the ads by one other 
dimension. 

194
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:13,520
Some participants saw the ad for the 
watch and it was plain. 

195
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,270
Nothing about it was particularly 
different. 

196
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:19,860
It was either situated in a sexual scene 
or mountain scene. 

197
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,340
But other participants saw the ads and 
they saw the watch being draped by a red 

198
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,366
ribbon. 
And underneath the ad, we've written the 

199
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:34,470
tag line, this is a watch that men will 
give to the special woman in their lives. 

200
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,958
So, in these conditions, we hope to bring 
up the idea of a resource transfer from 

201
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,548
men to women. 
And in this way, we thought that we could 

202
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:50,390
get women to view the sexual ads as being 
more appealing than they would otherwise. 

203
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:54,44
So, what we know from previous research 
is that, women don't generally like 

204
00:15:54,44 --> 00:15:58,445
sexual ads. 
They view them as unfavorable, unlikable, 

205
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:03,242
crass, crude and so on. 
And so, our goal with this experiment was 

206
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:07,768
to see if we could get women to think of 
about a sexual ad or sexual imagery as 

207
00:16:07,768 --> 00:16:13,856
representing resource transfer between a 
man and a woman. 

208
00:16:13,856 --> 00:16:17,320
Maybe women would like the sexual imagery 
more. 

209
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,214
So, our prediction was that when women 
saw a sexual ad and that sexual ad 

210
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:25,570
reminded them of gifts that men give to 
special women in their lives, they would 

211
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,662
like the sexual ad more than if the 
sexual ad had no reminders of gifts being 

212
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:37,230
given from men to women. 
And that is exactly what we found. 

213
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,455
We found that when women saw a sexual ad, 
compared to a mountain ad, they didn't 

214
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:46,98
like the sexual ad very much. 
They thought it was relatively 

215
00:16:46,98 --> 00:16:50,578
unfavorable, unlikable and so on. 
But when women saw a sexual ad that was 

216
00:16:50,578 --> 00:16:54,802
paired with the understanding that the 
product in the ad could be used by a man 

217
00:16:54,802 --> 00:17:01,850
to honor the special woman in his life, 
then they liked the sexual ad much more. 

218
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,946
And in fact, it became statistically 
equivalent to their feelings about the 

219
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:10,260
non-sexual ad. 
So, this was quite remarkable because in 

220
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,0
general, women take a hard stance against 
sexual imagery and they tend not to like 

221
00:17:14,0 --> 00:17:17,530
it. 
And this was a novel finding that we 

222
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:21,690
could make women appreciate sexual 
imagery more because of this reminder of 

223
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:26,232
resource transfer. 
Now, in the second experiment, we 

224
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:30,562
conducted, we wanted to understand 
several new things. 

225
00:17:30,562 --> 00:17:34,405
One, we wanted to shift the idea of 
resource transfer away from something 

226
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:38,838
that was a monetary and, you know, 
physical, like a gift. 

227
00:17:38,838 --> 00:17:43,453
And move it to something that, especially 
modern women, are interested in receiving 

228
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:48,622
emotional and relational resources. 
And so, in study two, we connected the 

229
00:17:48,622 --> 00:17:54,16
idea of resource transfers from men to 
women in an emotional relational way. 

230
00:17:54,16 --> 00:17:56,980
And I'll tell you in a minute how we did 
that. 

231
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,992
The second thing we did in experiment two 
that was different from experiment one, 

232
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:04,827
is we, not only measured how women felt 
about sexual imagery, we also measured 

233
00:18:04,827 --> 00:18:09,255
their mood. 
Because our hypothesis was, is that 

234
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,740
sexual imagery, when it's used without 
mentions of resource transfer, makes 

235
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,260
women upset and angry. 
But that, when resource transfer is 

236
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:23,200
involved in the sexual imagery, that that 
would soften women's negative mood. 

237
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,780
And so, in this experiment we have women 
coming into the lab. 

238
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,350
And the first thing they do for us is 
they do a proofreading task. 

239
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:35,445
In a proofreading task, their job is to 
read a paragraph of text and to find if 

240
00:18:35,445 --> 00:18:39,960
we have misspellings or grammar errors in 
the text. 

241
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,584
This task is one where we are able then, 
to get women exposed to different types 

242
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:48,230
of information. 
And in this experiment, we have them 

243
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,620
reading text that refers to one of three 
themes. 

244
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,354
We have a loyalty prime. 
And a, the loyalty prime condition are 

245
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:59,130
participants who are reading about a man 
and a woman, who are a couple, and the 

246
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:04,197
man is extremely loyal to the woman. 
So, for example, it would read things 

247
00:19:04,197 --> 00:19:08,60
like, John and Mary are young and have a 
lot going for them. 

248
00:19:08,60 --> 00:19:11,842
Their friends notice how completely 
devoted John is to Mary and how he used 

249
00:19:11,842 --> 00:19:16,10
to lead a bachelor lifestyle but that all 
has changed. 

250
00:19:16,10 --> 00:19:21,439
We, also, in another condition, had 
subjects reading about a disloyalty 

251
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:24,364
prime. 
And in this proofreading task, our 

252
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:27,262
subjects also read about John and Mary, 
who are also a young couple with a lot 

253
00:19:27,262 --> 00:19:31,359
going for them. 
But in this condition our subjects also 

254
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:35,913
read that all their friends noticed that 
John is not completely devoted to Mary 

255
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:40,191
and that John used to lead a bachelor 
lifestyle and that not, has not really 

256
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:45,740
changed. 
So now, they're thinking about men, not 

257
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,870
being very loyal to women and not 
transferring those emotional and 

258
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,410
relational resources. 
And then, in the third aspect of this 

259
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:58,710
proofreading task, we also have our 
subjects reading about John and Mary. 

260
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,919
But now, John and Mary are students at 
the university who are both involved with 

261
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,910
the university organization, the student 
senate. 

262
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,779
So, they read about the two of them 
working on activities together. 

263
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,612
After one of these three proofreading 
tasks, now we have our subjects looking 

264
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:19,550
at the sexual imagery or the mountain 
imagery. 

265
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:25,545
Again, in a way to view a product. 
And our prediction was, that when women 

266
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:29,185
are reminded of a lack of research 
transfer from men to women, so the 

267
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:34,548
disloyalty prime condition. 
They review the sexual imagery in a very 

268
00:20:34,548 --> 00:20:38,193
negative fashion. 
But when women read about the loyalty 

269
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:41,910
prime and that activated for them the 
idea of emotional and relational 

270
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,131
resources being transferred from men to 
women that they would like the sexual ad 

271
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:50,100
more. 
And they would find it more appealing. 

272
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,10
And that is what we found. 
So, women's reactions to the sexual 

273
00:20:54,10 --> 00:20:58,350
imagery was predicted by whether we 
reminded them of a loyal relationship 

274
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:05,20
partner, a disloyal relationship partner 
or a neutral relationship. 

275
00:21:05,20 --> 00:21:08,650
We found that reactions to the ad were 
most negative when women were reminded of 

276
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:12,666
a disloyal partner. 
But reactions to the sexual ad were more 

277
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:16,470
positive when women were reminded of a 
loyal partner. 

278
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,227
Again, stimulating that idea of emotional 
and relational resources from men to 

279
00:21:21,227 --> 00:21:24,687
women. 
And reactions to the sexual ad fell in 

280
00:21:24,687 --> 00:21:29,42
between for our participants who read 
about John and Mary being in the student 

281
00:21:29,42 --> 00:21:33,238
senate. 
Furthermore, I told you that we tested 

282
00:21:33,238 --> 00:21:35,850
mood. 
And our idea was that when women read 

283
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,130
about a sexual ad, that doesn't include 
resource transfer, that makes them angry. 

284
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,46
And that is what we found. 
That women we're the most upset about the 

285
00:21:45,46 --> 00:21:49,206
ad and they registered the highest degree 
of negative emotions when they saw a 

286
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:53,366
sexual imagery seen, that was preceded by 
a reminder of men, not being loyal to 

287
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:58,56
women. 
But when women read about men being loyal 

288
00:21:58,56 --> 00:22:01,566
to women, seeing this sexual imagery 
didn't make them all that upset and their 

289
00:22:01,566 --> 00:22:07,184
negative emotions were lower. 
So, we've found evidence for the idea 

290
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:12,210
that women like the concept of resource 
transfer from men to women. 

291
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,110
And that when that idea of transfer is 
broken in the, like the disloyalty 

292
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:20,530
condition, that they get quite upset and 
they have a negative reaction to the idea 

293
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:26,210
of sex. 
So, in conclusion, the lecture today has 

294
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:31,241
made several points. 
One is that female sexuality is treated 

295
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:35,891
as if it has value and is precious and 
has a price, so to speak, and hence, sex 

296
00:22:35,891 --> 00:22:42,650
is a female resource. 
Male sexuality, conversely, has no such 

297
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,813
value. 
Countries, cultures, and individuals do 

298
00:22:45,813 --> 00:22:51,230
not treat male sexuality as if it is 
precious or can be traded for a price. 

299
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,756
There is a sexual marketplace that 
exists, that link couples together 

300
00:22:55,756 --> 00:23:02,580
whereas, where women can trade sex for 
other resources that men might give them. 

301
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,564
These might be gifts or money or rights 
or relationship commitment or affection, 

302
00:23:08,564 --> 00:23:13,242
or children. 
And last, data from my own lab has shown 

303
00:23:13,242 --> 00:23:18,170
that linking resource transfers for the 
idea of men giving women resources, 

304
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:23,329
possibly a gift, possibly relationship 
loyalty, that makes the idea of sex seem 

305
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,823
more appealing to women.
