1
00:00:00,609 --> 00:00:06,264
So if you think about this issue of what
happens when you on an emotional state,

2
00:00:06,264 --> 00:00:12,006
and you're trying to predict how you would
feel and how you would behave and what

3
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:17,574
kind of decision you would make when
you're not in an emotional state, we call

4
00:00:17,574 --> 00:00:23,315
this an intra-empathy problem.
Because what you're trying to understand

5
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:28,415
how you would be under an emotional state.
Usually when you think about empathy is

6
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:33,621
about how you understand somebody else but
in this case it's about your own state.

7
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:37,007
So you can think about what happens when
you're in an emotional state.

8
00:00:37,008 --> 00:00:39,884
You're angry with somebody and you say to
yourself.

9
00:00:39,885 --> 00:00:44,555
How would I behave later when I'm not
angry, and you probably mis-predict your

10
00:00:44,555 --> 00:00:47,717
anger, you think that your later self
would be as angry.

11
00:00:47,718 --> 00:00:50,200
And the same thing is when you're in the
cold stage right now.

12
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,070
You're not hot, you're not aroused and so
on.

13
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,218
And you ask yourself, how would I behave
later, when I'm aroused or angry, and so

14
00:00:57,218 --> 00:01:00,015
on.
And there's lots of examples for that.

15
00:01:00,016 --> 00:01:03,973
Eh, one of them is a, is a beautiful
example about movies.

16
00:01:03,973 --> 00:01:09,620
[music] Eh, when you ask people about what
movies they think eh, they should watch

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,766
eh, people often think that kind of
high-class French movies, eh, without

18
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:20,410
subtitles, and black and white, and maybe
things like Schindler's List and so on.

19
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:23,503
These are good movies that you'd watch in
principle.

20
00:01:23,504 --> 00:01:27,512
And sometimes when they have Netflix, they
put those movies in the high place in

21
00:01:27,512 --> 00:01:31,514
their queue, because they basically think
they should be the kind of people who

22
00:01:31,514 --> 00:01:35,750
watch these movies.
But what happen when people basically go

23
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,092
to watch a movie?
Now theyre in a different state, its not

24
00:01:39,092 --> 00:01:43,656
in principle, for later, its for now.
And what happened is that people end up

25
00:01:43,656 --> 00:01:48,657
renting way too often things like, Rambo.
Nothing bad about Rambo but, instead of

26
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:53,211
renting the things that are good for us in
principle, we rent the kind of things that

27
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,358
would fulfill our desires tonight and
these are often much simpler.

28
00:01:57,358 --> 00:02:01,367
Movies in, languages we understand.
Not so black and white.

29
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:07,470
And not so high, high, class movies.
Another example is another experiment by

30
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,086
George Lowenson and his colleagues.
And in this experiment, they got people,

31
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:17,525
in the gym, to figure out how important
our water related causes in the world?

32
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:20,320
Right.
How much money would you give?

33
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,180
How much effort, would join a charity
dinner?

34
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,967
Would you donate your time, your money
into those charities?

35
00:02:26,968 --> 00:02:31,382
And they basically got people either when
they just started exercising, so they were

36
00:02:31,382 --> 00:02:34,324
not very thirsty.
Or they waited awhile and they got them

37
00:02:34,324 --> 00:02:38,107
when they were thirsty.
And what happened, the moment people

38
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:43,696
became thirsty, all of a sudden they had
higher empathy with other people who might

39
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:48,880
be thirsty as well and were willing to
contribute more money, more time, they

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,792
thought the charities were more important.
Now, when you became more thirsty.

41
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:57,718
Food-related causes did not become more
interesting for you.

42
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,804
Just water-related causes.
Now, if you think about it, there's a

43
00:03:02,804 --> 00:03:05,757
question of, how do you create a charity
dinner?

44
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:09,979
Many charity dinners, you bring people in,
they eat well, they drink well, and then

45
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:13,822
somebody comes on stage and tries to ask
them for money, tell them what a good

46
00:03:13,822 --> 00:03:17,068
charity it is.
I think a much better approach is not to

47
00:03:17,068 --> 00:03:19,610
give them any food and not to given them
any drinks.

48
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,496
In fact you want to tell them in advance
to come prepared for a wonderful meal, and

49
00:03:23,496 --> 00:03:27,680
maybe not to eat the whole day.
Then you get them to sit there and the

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,466
smells from the kitchen to come in.
And they have plates and forks and so on

51
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:37,110
but the food is not there yet.
And now you tell them how important it is.

52
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,490
And now you get them to have higher
empathy to these causes, what it feels

53
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:46,546
like to be hungry and thirsty and so on.
And my prediction is that now they will

54
00:03:46,546 --> 00:03:48,073
give much more money.
