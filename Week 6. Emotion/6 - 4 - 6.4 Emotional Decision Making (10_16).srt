1
00:00:01,236 --> 00:00:09,556
one very useful story to help us think
about the identifiable victim effect is

2
00:00:09,556 --> 00:00:15,562
the story of Baby Jessica.
Baby Jessica was a little girl in Texas

3
00:00:15,562 --> 00:00:19,536
that fell to a hole.
This was u, some kind of digging h, device

4
00:00:19,536 --> 00:00:24,420
and she fell into it and she was there for
quite a long time for I think about 50

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,860
hours or so.
But she, she was stuck there.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,051
It was really, it was really sad and our
hearts went to her.

7
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:36,107
And you know what, she had more CNN and
coverage than Rwanda and Darfur put

8
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:38,340
together.
And the question is why?

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,597
And of course it's about the fact that she
was young, cute, innocent girl, who fell

10
00:00:44,597 --> 00:00:48,340
into the well.
And we could all look at the TV coverage.

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,909
We could all sympathize.
We could all feel her pain and the pain of

12
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:56,088
her parents.
And there were some as this drama evolved.

13
00:00:56,088 --> 00:01:02,306
Eventually somebody rescued her and that
picture is an incredibly iconic picture in

14
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:05,349
the history of rescue.
And everybody was very happy.

15
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,550
By the way, after the fact, people started
donating money to Baby Jessica.

16
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:12,155
She was already safe.
But after the fact, she don-, they donated

17
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,246
money for her.
And she became a very wealthy young lady,

18
00:01:15,246 --> 00:01:19,109
when she, came of age, and could get,
could get this money.

19
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,587
Why do we care so much about her and not
about, not about other things?

20
00:01:26,588 --> 00:01:29,339
And this of course is the problem of
genocide.

21
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,479
And you can look at the history of the
world and you can look at all kinds of

22
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,290
terrible things that have happened.
And every time, we wake up after the

23
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,970
tragedy and we say, never again, never
again.

24
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,316
And every time, it happens again and again
and again.

25
00:01:44,316 --> 00:01:49,966
And if you just look at the list of all
the genocide that happen in the world this

26
00:01:49,966 --> 00:01:54,200
is just incredibly sad.
And this of course is not new observation.

27
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,084
You can see all kinds of thoughtful people
in our past who have commented on this

28
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:02,280
idea.
>> [music] I am deeply moved if I see one

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,762
man suffering and would risk my life for
him.

30
00:02:05,763 --> 00:02:10,768
Then I talk impersonally about the
possible pulverization of our big cities,

31
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:14,485
with a hundred million dead.
I am unable to multiply one man's

32
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:21,256
suffering by a hundred million.
>> The numbers are important, and yet

33
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:25,189
there are not everything.
For whatever reasons, images often strike

34
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,193
us more powerfully, more deeply than
numbers.

35
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:32,622
We seem unable to hold the emotions
aroused by numbers for nearly as long as

36
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:35,726
those of images.
We quickly grow numb to the facts and the

37
00:02:35,726 --> 00:02:42,594
math.
>> The atrocities that were known remained

38
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:48,790
abstract and remote.
Because the savagery of genocide so defies

39
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:53,222
our everyday experience, many of us failed
to wrap our minds around it.

40
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:57,898
Bystanders were thus able to retreat to
the twilight between knowing and not

41
00:02:57,898 --> 00:03:03,193
knowing.
>> The discussion of an infallible victim

42
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:07,280
effect is mostly kind of depressing, but
there is a brighter version of it, which

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,738
is to look at what spammers are doing.
And spammers are interesting because they

44
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:15,786
try different version, they learn what's
working and not working.

45
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:20,125
And if you got spam, you probably got spam
that looks much like this.

46
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:25,230
From somebody who's a twenty three year
old female in somewhere in Africa and she

47
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,180
has a particular problem and you can get
pictures of her and you can create all of

48
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,800
those things.
And of course, what spammers are trying to

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,975
do are trying to create an emotional link
with us, they try to portray themselves as

50
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:43,858
individuals, individuals in problems.
When they try to get us to care about

51
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,444
them, to want to work with them, to want
to help them.

52
00:03:47,445 --> 00:03:53,466
I've talked to some people who are working
for companies like Yahoo and Microsoft and

53
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:58,944
trying to basically reduce the chances
that they're users are going to fall for

54
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:03,509
those scams.
And what, what happens, what they say

55
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,994
often is that they get them through some
church bulletin board or through some

56
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:11,419
online dating.
And they started to create a relationship

57
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:15,399
with them that last over a while.
And they ask for money first and they ask

58
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:18,050
for then a little bit and little bit more
and so on.

59
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,610
It's the relationship that they build and
the caring that they build and then they

60
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,264
abuse to a very high degree.
And, so this is what spammers and, you

61
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:33,682
know, people who tries to get us to part
with our money, doing the internet in

62
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:37,200
terms of using the identifiable victim
effect.

63
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,360
There's one more thing that is not
connected to that, that is just worthwhile

64
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,791
mentioning as long as we deal with
spammers and scammers.

65
00:04:44,791 --> 00:04:50,012
If you got these letters, these emails,
you probably noticed that their grammar is

66
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:52,617
not that good.
And the question is why.

67
00:04:52,618 --> 00:04:55,547
And one possibility is that they just
can't write.

68
00:04:55,548 --> 00:04:58,610
But there's been another suggestion, which
is kind of interesting.

69
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,835
And that suggestion is that they do it on
purpose.

70
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:06,090
The their problem is that they send lots
of emails out, and they want the email

71
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,502
that comes back to be from the people who
are the most gullible, the most ones who

72
00:05:11,502 --> 00:05:15,464
are likely to follow.
If many of us who would never go with

73
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:20,469
those scams, would start writing them,
they would be burdened by the amount of

74
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:25,089
work that they have to respond to all
these people as they try to push them

75
00:05:25,089 --> 00:05:30,039
through the different steps of the scams.
So what they want is they want a system

76
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,938
that would leave the gullible people in
the system and get rid of all the people

77
00:05:34,938 --> 00:05:39,685
who might not follow with them.
And one suggestion has been that adding

78
00:05:39,685 --> 00:05:45,510
spelling mistakes are actually a way to
differentiate between those two people.

79
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,416
But if they wrote in a nice way, maybe
more people who would not be, giving the

80
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:53,560
money at the end of the day will come into
the final, wouldn't waste their time.

81
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,048
So by creating lots of spelling mistakes,
they get rid of some of the less gullible

82
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:00,380
people.
They stay with the more gullible people.

83
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,260
And this way they can concentrate their
efforts.

84
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,275
Now, the evidence for this is just
starting to build up, but I think it's

85
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:11,980
interesting.
In any case I think that spammers are

86
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:17,017
people who are getting very quick learning
process because they get to send lots of

87
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:20,220
emails.
They get to get lots of responses back,

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,964
and very quickly, they can learn and
adapt.

89
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:29,896
Sad, but if you wanted to be in the domain
of learning something about human behavior

90
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:36,647
spamming this probably a good place to
learn how people really think and behave.

91
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:40,991
When we thing of that emotions and
cognitive inputs into, into decision,

92
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:44,787
there's a question of when does one of
them overpower the other.

93
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:48,763
And when do we get the kind of information
is actually good for us.

94
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:52,717
So there was one early experiment that I
really, really love.

95
00:06:52,718 --> 00:06:57,690
And they got people into a room and they
say, which jam would you like to buy?

96
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:01,340
And they showed them all kind of jams.
And to other people they said, which kind

97
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,364
of poster would you like to get?
And then the people got the jam that they

98
00:07:05,364 --> 00:07:09,844
wanted or got the poster they wanted and
they went to their dorm room and ate or

99
00:07:09,844 --> 00:07:13,039
didn't eat the jam and hang or didn't hang
the poster.

100
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,654
And they went back and they measured later
how much jam did they eat and did they

101
00:07:17,654 --> 00:07:20,877
hang the poster or not.
But here's a thing.

102
00:07:20,877 --> 00:07:25,810
When they initially made them decide, some
people, they just said, just decide.

103
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,579
Use your emotion.
What would you like?

104
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,340
And some people, they gave them cognitive
input.

105
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,253
They gave them ratings from experts.
They gave them all kinds of other

106
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,200
information.
Which one of them do you think was the

107
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,790
right one?
The ones including just the emotion in the

108
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,280
beginning of the one including both the
emotion and the cognitive input.

109
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,259
Well, when people just based, work based
on emotion.

110
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,820
They made decisions they liked better on.
If they bought jam based on emotions, they

111
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:55,295
got jam and they ate the jam.
If they got their poster based on emotion,

112
00:07:55,295 --> 00:07:57,407
they got their poster and they put it on
the wall.

113
00:07:57,408 --> 00:08:01,140
But if people started using more of
cognitive thought, all of a sudden they

114
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,750
got jam that they did not use and they got
poster that they did not hang up.

115
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,918
Why?
The reality is the consumption experience

116
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:12,137
of jams and posters is all about the
emotions.

117
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:14,827
What do you get?
What kind of pleasure do you get?

118
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,310
When it's on your wall or when you're
eating it in the morning.

119
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,490
It's not about cognitive thought.
So what this suggest is that when the

120
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,458
decision environment Includes the same
element as the consumption environment,

121
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:30,262
that will be the ideal situation.
And if you have a situation in which

122
00:08:30,262 --> 00:08:34,282
includes something irrelevant to the
consumption, that is not going to work

123
00:08:34,282 --> 00:08:36,819
out.
So it means to think, it means that their

124
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:39,476
inputs or emotional cognition are
different.

125
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:43,346
And it means that you want to think about
what is your conceptional experience when

126
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,302
to be like.
Are you going to be consuming based on

127
00:08:46,302 --> 00:08:50,270
emotion or based on cognition, and how can
you make the decision environment

128
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,717
encapsulate those elements that are going
to be relevant later.

129
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:56,364
Another example for this is from Chris
Hsee.

130
00:08:56,364 --> 00:09:00,858
Imagine you go into a store and you see
different speakers for your new, wonderful

131
00:09:00,858 --> 00:09:04,578
stereo.
And some speakers look more beautiful, and

132
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:08,046
some sound better.
What's more important?

133
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:12,557
Well, when you stand in the store, you see
them side by side.

134
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:17,160
So now, all of a sudden, tiny differences
in quality might seem very big for you.

135
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,544
Because you put your headphone on, and you
say, left, right, left, right.

136
00:09:20,544 --> 00:09:24,027
And tiny differences in quality might seem
relevant.

137
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,619
And you might decide to get the ugly one
that sounds likely better.

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
But then you take it home, and when you
take it home you only have one speaker.

139
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,590
And you can't do the, compare this one to
this one and this one to this one, all of

140
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,710
a sudden you get just one.
And now you got one that has slightly

141
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,080
higher quality of sound but is uglier, and
the ugliness stays with you for a long,

142
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,039
for a long time.
So, think about this notion, of the fit,

143
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,807
between the decision environment and the
consumption environment.

144
00:09:55,808 --> 00:10:00,661
And think about what roles are emotions
playing in one, versus the other.

145
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:05,185
And if you can get those to be more
compatible and more similar, you can

146
00:10:05,185 --> 00:10:09,348
actually get people, and yourself, to make
better decisions.
