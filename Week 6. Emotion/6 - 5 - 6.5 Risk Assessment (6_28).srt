1
00:00:00,693 --> 00:00:07,518
Another area where emotions enter the
picture in a big way is our assessment of

2
00:00:07,518 --> 00:00:13,609
what's risky and what's not risky.
So, think to yourself for example, what

3
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:17,805
are the odds that you would die from
different things?

4
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:24,020
Say, heart attack shark attacks drowning
shooting, car accidents, and so on.

5
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,332
And the question is, what makes you
believe that you're likely to die from one

6
00:00:29,332 --> 00:00:33,086
thing versus the other?
Many years ago Paul Slovic did a study

7
00:00:33,086 --> 00:00:37,112
exactly like that and what he found was
that whatever was mentioned in the

8
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:41,732
newspaper the month before we asked people
this question, those are the things that

9
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:45,954
make them make them believe that they're
going to die from them.

10
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:49,878
So for example, what do you think you're
more likely to die from, a falling

11
00:00:49,878 --> 00:00:53,764
airplane, that some airplane would lose
some piece of thing, and it would hit you

12
00:00:53,764 --> 00:00:57,424
over the head, or from shark attacks?
Most people think shark attacks, right?

13
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:59,675
Why?
Because it's much more salient in our

14
00:00:59,675 --> 00:01:02,750
mind.
There are movies about shark attacks.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,107
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Nobody has made a movie about falling

16
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,506
airplane parts.
And because of that, our beliefs about

17
00:01:09,506 --> 00:01:13,926
what's dangerous and not dangerous is
actually not coming from the reality of

18
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:17,390
what's dangerous or not.
It comes from our mindset.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,887
What's easy for us to imagine that is
dangerous.

20
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:24,270
On top of that, there's what comes to
mind.

21
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,246
And on top of that, there's the question
of salience of the emotion.

22
00:01:28,246 --> 00:01:31,767
Not just the ease of coming to mind but
the actual emotion.

23
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:36,316
I grew up in Israel and I go back to visit
quite frequently, and every time I go

24
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:40,780
people ask me if I'm not afraid to go
back, and the reality is I'm afraid from

25
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,830
drivers, not from terrorism.
But of course people are afraid from

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,199
terrorism, not from driving.
If you look at the base rate of what the

27
00:01:49,199 --> 00:01:53,407
people are likely to die of, driving is
much more likely than terrorism.

28
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,708
But of course terrorism is very different
with driving you have the feeling that

29
00:01:57,708 --> 00:02:01,270
you're in control.
You're driving, you're making decisions

30
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,241
and so on.
Terrorism, it's out of your control.

31
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:09,269
Somebody's doing it on purpose for you.
It's somebody's doing it randomly.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,293
You have nothing to do about it, and
because of that the emotion is much, is

33
00:02:13,293 --> 00:02:18,328
much, much higher.
And that emotion causes fear to a much

34
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:22,405
higher degree.
Some time I jokingly tell my students that

35
00:02:22,405 --> 00:02:26,961
if they want to get into a good business,
a good business could be to sell insurance

36
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:32,313
against nuclear disasters.
Why?

37
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:36,012
Because people are really, really afraid
of nuclear disasters, and they are willing

38
00:02:36,012 --> 00:02:38,961
to pay a lot from it.
And on top of that, if it actually

39
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:44,899
happens, you might not have to pay out.
So, there is a question of what things are

40
00:02:44,899 --> 00:02:50,203
we afraid of and how is what we're afraid
of actually connected to the base rates to

41
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:55,195
whats really happening, to our memory of
what we, is salient in our memory and

42
00:02:55,195 --> 00:03:00,421
therefore we think it happens and what
we're actually afraid of, and what is more

43
00:03:00,421 --> 00:03:04,037
frightening and because of that create
higher fear.

44
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:08,003
As we talk about emotions, we've talked
about all emotions and we just put them in

45
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:11,160
one kind of big bucket, as if all emotions
are actually the same.

46
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,520
Now, it's not true that all emotions are
the same.

47
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,586
There are many different emotions and
different levels of emotions.

48
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:21,982
There are some emotions that are kind of
big emotions, primary emotion arousal,

49
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:27,141
anger, emotions that come from feeling of
hunger and, and things that are kind of

50
00:03:27,141 --> 00:03:30,839
incredibly powerful.
And then there are things that are not as

51
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:33,559
emotional.
For example, what happens when you see

52
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:37,806
somebody else suffering or what happens
when you read something, something in a

53
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,052
book.
Now, for the, the simplicity of the

54
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,684
discussion, we've bundled them all
together.

55
00:03:42,684 --> 00:03:47,234
But, of course, their power, the power of
these emotions to work on us depend to

56
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:50,829
some degree about how primary they are and
how basic they are.

57
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:55,184
And the more primary they are, the more we
are going to be able to get our, hijack

58
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:59,606
our system and get them, get us to do what
they, emotions, want in some sense, and

59
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:03,760
the weaker and most social the emotional
are, for example, emotions about

60
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,859
embarrassment and so on, they are going to
be less, less powerful.

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,109
As a summary, what can we say about
emotions?

62
00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:17,723
The first thing we need to recognize is
they're inherent part of us.

63
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:20,210
They're evolutionary, they're the most
basic part of us.

64
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,690
Now, in some sense the most true part of
ourselves.

65
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,916
We have this cognitive system that we can
try to redirect our emotions and behave

66
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:32,120
differently.
But emotions are the basis of human

67
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,560
nature.
The second thing we need to understand is

68
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,067
that emotion and cognition don't add up to
each other.

69
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,710
When emotion starts acting, it can take
over.

70
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,540
It can basically create a whole new set of
behaviors, a whole new set of preferences,

71
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,780
and we don't necessarily see it coming.
And then on the other side, we need to

72
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,544
understand that emotions are sometimes
good and sometimes bad.

73
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:58,079
Ask yourself, would you like to live in an
environment where everybody was without

74
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,820
emotions?
No, of course not.

75
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,461
Emotions are incredibly useful but also
incredibly dangerous.

76
00:05:03,461 --> 00:05:07,914
And we have this duality and we need to
recognize where are the cases where

77
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:11,778
emotions are useful.
For example, when giving are giving to

78
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:16,834
each other, when people care about
reciprocity and they care about honesty,

79
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:21,969
and they care about be good to other
people and we get some pleasure from all

80
00:05:21,969 --> 00:05:26,053
of those things.
We also need to recognize the places where

81
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:30,750
emotions don't get us to act in a
particularly useful way and this duality

82
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,387
is crucially important if we actually want
to get people to behave well.

83
00:05:35,388 --> 00:05:39,116
So, how do we understand emotions?
How do we understand where it works for

84
00:05:39,116 --> 00:05:42,728
us, where it works against us?
In trying to get more of it when it's

85
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:45,760
working for us and less of it when it
works against us.

86
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:58,366
That I think is the main lesson or recipe
from emotions to better decision making.
