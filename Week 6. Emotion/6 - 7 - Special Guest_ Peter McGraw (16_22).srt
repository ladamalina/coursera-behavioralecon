1
00:00:06,70 --> 00:00:09,728
My name is Peter McGraw and I'm an 
Associate Professor of Marketing and 

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:13,880
Psychology at the University of Colorado 
at Boulder. 

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,291
And I've studied judgement, emotion and 
choice. 

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:22,950
And along my travels on this research 
topic I stumbled onto the question. 

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:29,160
What makes things funny? 
And as a result of that that experience. 

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,610
I started the humor research lab at the 
University of Colorado, Boulder. 

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,640
And I'm going to be talking about what 
makes things funny from a psychological 

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,50
perspective. 
So the question of what makes things 

9
00:00:41,50 --> 00:00:44,120
funny is actually a surprisingly 
important question. 

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,190
And that is the consequences of humor 
have really important implications for 

11
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,920
how we live. 
So people who are funny are well liked. 

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,620
Humorous things are really attention 
getting. 

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:00,280
It's something that influences the 
choices that we make in terms of how we 

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,870
spend our leisure time, our leisure 
dollars. 

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,420
It influences who our friends are, who we 
end up dating, who we end up marrying, 

16
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,309
and unfortunately sometimes who we end up 
divorcing. 

17
00:01:15,50 --> 00:01:18,380
Those types of effects are really obvious 
and very clear. 

18
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,610
What's less clear is what it is that 
actually makes things humourous. 

19
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,737
And I'm going to focus today on the 
antecedents and at the end of the talk 

20
00:01:27,737 --> 00:01:32,385
I'll connect these antecedents to some of 
these important consequences. 

21
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:37,270
So let's do a little bit of housekeeping 
first. 

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:41,808
What is humor? 
I think of humor as a response, a 

23
00:01:41,808 --> 00:01:50,58
response that people experience in one of 
three ways, or all of three ways. 

24
00:01:50,58 --> 00:01:55,419
So humor is a cognitive response, a 
judgement. 

25
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:59,509
Hey, that's funny. 
It's an emotional response. 

26
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:04,53
This positive of feeling, this positive 
feeling of amusement that we have when we 

27
00:02:04,53 --> 00:02:09,180
perceive something as humorous. 
And then finally a behavioral response. 

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,84
The tendency to laugh. 
Now, of course, you don't always laugh at 

29
00:02:12,84 --> 00:02:14,690
things that you see funny, but it tends 
to have a theory there. 

30
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,15
So, there are many theories of humor. 
They go back thousands of years. 

31
00:02:15,15 --> 00:02:20,610
Freud had a theory of what makes things 
funny. 

32
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:31,400
In which he described humor as a release 
of sexual or aggressive tensions. 

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,590
And many things that people laugh at seem 
to have that element. 

34
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:39,660
Although Freud's theory has been largely 
abandoned. 

35
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,700
Plato and Socrates talked about humor and 
described it as something that occurs 

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:51,429
when bad things happen to other people, 
that we laugh at other people's misery. 

37
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,654
I think Hobbes put it best in Laviathan 
he wrote that humor, the laughter occurs 

38
00:02:58,654 --> 00:03:04,330
in response to sudden glory over our 
enemies. 

39
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,746
And then the most sort of compelling 
predominate theory of humor today is one 

40
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:13,683
based on incongruity. 
That is that there's something surprising 

41
00:03:13,683 --> 00:03:17,930
or something that we expect but don't 
actually get. 

42
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,480
There's some mismatch between 
expectations and reality. 

43
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,663
And some pretty fart smart folks like 
Emmanuel Cont has suggested that, that 

44
00:03:26,663 --> 00:03:30,920
humor occurs as a response to 
incongruity. 

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,439
So the research that we've been doing in 
the humor research lab says, shows that 

46
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,850
there's some problems with each of these 
different types of theories. 

47
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,486
So putting them all together, 
accidentally killing a loved one would 

48
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:48,426
would foster a release in aggressive 
tension, would assert your superiority 

49
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:54,360
and certainly would be an expected turn 
of events. 

50
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,778
But it's hard, hardly laughable. 
Instead what we argue is that humor comes 

51
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:05,560
from benign violations. 
So what do I mean by benign violations? 

52
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,864
Well it's actually a little bit of a 
counter intuitive thought, that idea that 

53
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:16,402
humor actually starts with something that 
is wrong Unsettling, threatening in some 

54
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:22,30
way. 
It violates the way you see the world. 

55
00:04:22,30 --> 00:04:25,780
The way the world ought to be. 
Some pretty smart people have recognized 

56
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,54
this to be the case. 
Mark Twain said that the secret source of 

57
00:04:30,54 --> 00:04:36,210
humor is not joy, it's sorrow. 
There is no laughter in heaven. 

58
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,430
That is there's nothing wrong in heaven, 
thus there's nothing to laugh about. 

59
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,615
So in each of the previous theories I've 
discussed, you can see those negative 

60
00:04:43,615 --> 00:04:48,246
elements. 
Aggressive things tend to be negative. 

61
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:53,560
as, asserting superiority. 
Bad things are happening to other people. 

62
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,120
And in the sense that things that are 
unexpected, if they're unexpectedly bad. 

63
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,748
They can be violations. 
Now in the benign violation theory the 

64
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:06,140
range of violations is really quite 
broad. 

65
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:11,490
It could be physical threats. 
It could be violations of social norms. 

66
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,938
It could be violations of cultural norms. 
It could be violations of linguistic 

67
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:18,812
norms. 
So that things that are wrong vary. 

68
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:24,425
really quite broad. 
But of course, violations don't normally 

69
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:27,860
make us laugh, they cause negative 
emotions. 

70
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,472
And that's where you need the benign 
condition. 

71
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:37,122
That violation needs to simultaneously be 
seen as okay, acceptable, safe, or in our 

72
00:05:37,122 --> 00:05:43,700
vernacular, benign. 
So, take tickling for example, or play 

73
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,420
fighting, both are benign violations, 
they're mock attacks. 

74
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,68
So, they're threatening events, or 
physically threatening events that are 

75
00:05:52,68 --> 00:05:56,191
not intended to hurt. 
And, when is it that they cause laughter, 

76
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,828
that cause a humorous response? 
Well it's when they're not done too 

77
00:06:00,828 --> 00:06:05,750
aggressively and when they're done by 
someone Who you trust. 

78
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,600
So, for instance, you can't tickle 
yourself. 

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,580
There's no violation there, there's 
nothing threatening about that situation. 

80
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:18,404
Similarly, if a creepy stranger walked up 
to you on the street and tired to tickle 

81
00:06:18,404 --> 00:06:23,60
you, it's hardly going to be a funny 
situation. 

82
00:06:23,60 --> 00:06:28,850
That situation is purely a violation. 
There is nothing okay about it. 

83
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:35,252
Benign violation approach also explains 
things like word play and puns to take 

84
00:06:35,252 --> 00:06:42,350
for example, this situation. 
If you find this this situation funny, 

85
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,630
it's likely cause you see how the 
phrasing of pen and is both wrong and not 

86
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,984
wrong. 
At the same time. 

87
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:56,520
So I'm going to present to you four good 
reasons why benign violations is a good 

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:03,580
theory for what makes things funny. 
So let's start with the idea of distance. 

89
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:08,930
so Mark Twain said, that comedy is 
tragedy plus time. 

90
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,120
And Mel Brooks similarly quipped that, 
tragedy is when I cut my finger. 

91
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,988
Comedy is when you fall down an open 
sewer and die. 

92
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:23,13
In both cases these humorists recognize 
that being far away from, being distant 

93
00:07:23,13 --> 00:07:30,85
from a tragedy helps enhance humor. 
And research in in our lab the Humor 

94
00:07:30,85 --> 00:07:34,726
Research Lab, AKA HURL, has found that to 
be the case. 

95
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:38,756
So, what happens is, is that for really 
severe violations like tragedies, 

96
00:07:38,756 --> 00:07:43,111
distance helps lower the threat of of the 
violation and helps transform this 

97
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:50,81
violation into a benign violation. 
But what's interesting is that distance 

98
00:07:50,81 --> 00:07:56,960
doesn't always help in some situations. 
As in the case of mild mishaps. 

99
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,40
Actually, moving closer may help enhance 
humor. 

100
00:08:00,40 --> 00:08:04,460
So let me give you an example, that, that 
illustrates this. 

101
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,680
Imagine a situation where you've been hit 
by a car. 

102
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:13,230
Which of the two situations would be 
funnier whether if it happened five years 

103
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,381
ago or if it happened yesterday. 
But what about a mild violation, like 

104
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:22,285
stubbing your toe, in what situation is 
more likely to be funny if it happened 

105
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:27,517
five years ago or yesterday? 
Well, participants in our laboratory 

106
00:08:27,517 --> 00:08:32,90
demonstrate how this reversal occurs. 
How the effect of distance depends on the 

107
00:08:32,90 --> 00:08:35,740
severity of the violation. 
Getting hit by a car five years ago is 

108
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,28
now distant and can be transformed into a 
benign violation but stubbing your toe 

109
00:08:40,28 --> 00:08:45,129
five years ago is so far away for this 
mild violation. 

110
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:49,155
It's not even worth our attention in 
actually moving closer to it makes it 

111
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:53,815
funnier. 
None of the previous theories can account 

112
00:08:53,815 --> 00:09:01,10
for this reversal of distance due to the 
severity of the violation. 

113
00:09:01,10 --> 00:09:04,670
The next piece of evidence is that many 
things that we laugh about, we also 

114
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,230
experience a little bit of negative 
emotions along the way. 

115
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:12,220
You can think about nervous laughter, 
when you're laughing at something that 

116
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,790
you know is wrong. 
Well, that occurs because you need to 

117
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,800
have something wrong to find something 
laughable. 

118
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,460
And so, we've been doing some research on 
moral violations and when moral 

119
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:29,6
violations can become funny. 
And what we find is that one way that you 

120
00:09:29,6 --> 00:09:33,353
can do this, is that you could have some 
alternative explanation that explains 

121
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:38,70
explains away the thing that is seemingly 
wrong. 

122
00:09:38,70 --> 00:09:41,170
So a, we use a scenario by Jonathan 
Height. 

123
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:47,320
A social psychologist. 
And I'll just read this along with you. 

124
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,510
Matthew is playing with his new kitten 
late one night. 

125
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,479
He is wearing only his boxer shorts, and 
sometimes the kitten walks over his 

126
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,760
genitals. 
Eventually, this arouses him and he 

127
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,10
begins to rub his bare genitals along the 
kittens body. 

128
00:10:02,10 --> 00:10:06,50
The kitten purrs and seems to enjoy the 
contact. 

129
00:10:06,50 --> 00:10:10,460
So this is very clearly a pretty 
disgusting scenario, and almost everybody 

130
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:16,220
agrees with that fact. 
But we find a large proportion of our 

131
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,781
participants also find the situation to 
be funny, so they're both disgusted and 

132
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,664
amused. 
As you can see I've underlined a 

133
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:29,440
particular passage in this scenario, the 
kitten purrs and seems to enjoy the 

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,947
contact. 
That helps make this violation benign, 

135
00:10:34,947 --> 00:10:40,360
that is, the kitten seems to be enjoying 
the experience also. 

136
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,180
No kitten is being harmed in the making 
of this scenario. 

137
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,660
In our study, we actually manipulated 
whether this sentence was present or a 

138
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,210
different pres-, sentence was present, 
where the kitten whines, and does not 

139
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:58,811
seem to enjoy the contact. 
In that situation, we have very low 

140
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:02,195
levels of amusement. 
There's nothing okay about this 

141
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:05,119
situation, and people are only disgusted 
by it. 

142
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,461
So, when you have a benign violation, you 
can end up having mixed emotions. 

143
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,670
It's I think very good support fact that 
something wrong has to be present there. 

144
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,695
The third support that I can present for 
benign violation account is the vast 

145
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:25,570
individual differences in what people 
find funny. 

146
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,795
What one person finds funny, another 
person might find boring and yet another 

147
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:34,510
person might find offensive. 
Why is that the case? 

148
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,30
Well humor is a uniquely individual thing 
and it's determined by one's values, 

149
00:11:40,30 --> 00:11:45,660
experiences and beliefs. 
What one person sees as a benign 

150
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,385
violation, another sees as totally benign 
and yet another sees as totally a 

151
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:54,745
violation. 
Shows that there's sort of this very, 

152
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:59,390
kind of, tough, going when you want to 
make something funny. 

153
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:03,107
You've got to find the sweet spot of 
comedy that perfectly matches these two 

154
00:12:03,107 --> 00:12:08,279
appraisals. 
So in one study we presented our 

155
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,558
participants with a scenario in which a 
church is trying to get people to come to 

156
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:22,300
the congregation, and they're raffling 
off an H2 Hummer SUV. 

157
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,95
And we find that people often find this 
this scenario to be upsetting. 

158
00:12:26,95 --> 00:12:30,60
But some group of people also find it to 
be amusing. 

159
00:12:30,60 --> 00:12:34,794
Who is it that finds it amusing? 
Well those are people who are not regular 

160
00:12:34,794 --> 00:12:38,56
church-goers. 
So they can recognize that this is 

161
00:12:38,56 --> 00:12:41,940
potentially threatening to the sanctity 
of the church. 

162
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,396
But because they don't care about it, 
they're not, they're not particularly 

163
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:49,310
hearing, adhering to any sort of 
religious doctrine. 

164
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,910
They have enough distance from it to see 
how it can be funny. 

165
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,595
People who are regular churchgoers how, 
however, don't find this scenario to be 

166
00:12:56,595 --> 00:13:01,610
amusing. 
They're only disgusted by it. 

167
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,750
The last piece of support is that the 
theory not only explains what is funny. 

168
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,134
But it also explains what is not funny. 
So in a, a study that we conducted in the 

169
00:13:12,134 --> 00:13:17,293
human research lab, we had a research 
assistant approach approach people on 

170
00:13:17,293 --> 00:13:24,759
campus and ask them to read a survey. 
And while they were reading the survey, 

171
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:29,808
she just looked at their faces. 
And she just coded how their, how they 

172
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,800
reacted facially to the information that 
we gave them. 

173
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,344
And we gave them a story that was similar 
to Keith Richard's acknowledgement that 

174
00:13:37,344 --> 00:13:42,260
he had snorted his dead father's ashes 
with some cocaine. 

175
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,464
So we made up a scenario akin to that. 
And with Keith, in which Keith's father 

176
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:49,536
tells his son to cremate his body, and 
that Keith can do whatever he wants to do 

177
00:13:49,536 --> 00:13:53,248
with the remains. 
So his dad gives him a license to do 

178
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:58,139
whatever he wants, and Keith decides to 
snort his dead father's ashes. 

179
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:03,76
What we've found was, that some people 
were upset by this, some people didn't 

180
00:14:03,76 --> 00:14:06,830
think it was a big deal, and some people 
laughed. 

181
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,330
And we asked them, can you see the 
situation as wrong, yes or no? 

182
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,660
Can you see the situation as not wrong, 
yes or no? 

183
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,629
And what we've found was only the people 
who saw it as wrong and not wrong were 

184
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:23,653
more likely to laugh and smile. 
The people who saw it as totally wrong 

185
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:27,685
were not, not likely to laugh and smile 
and the people who saw it as totally not 

186
00:14:27,685 --> 00:14:35,41
wrong were not likely to laugh and smile. 
In one case they were offended, in the 

187
00:14:35,41 --> 00:14:40,179
other case they were bored. 
So let's get back to the original 

188
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:45,440
question of what makes things funny. 
I hope I've been able to convince you 

189
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,6
that the answer is benign violations. 
And let me end with one last piece of 

190
00:14:51,6 --> 00:14:56,20
evidence that I think is really quite 
persuasive. 

191
00:14:56,20 --> 00:15:01,550
And that is that that a benign violation 
approach connects both the antecedents 

192
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:07,54
and the consequences of humor. 
So for instance, humor is this really 

193
00:15:07,54 --> 00:15:11,534
positive thing and it's something people 
hold liking and admiration for the people 

194
00:15:11,534 --> 00:15:15,818
who can create it. 
Well we should like people who can take 

195
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:20,220
the things that are bad in the world and 
somehow make them positive. 

196
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,629
Transform the violations into benign 
violations. 

197
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,792
Humor is attention-getting. 
Well, things that are wrong in the world 

198
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:32,118
tend to catch our attention. 
And one of the things that I hadn't 

199
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:36,733
mentioned yet, is that humor seems to be 
a very good way to help people cope with 

200
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:42,840
pain, stress, and adversity. 
And I think humor does that through one 

201
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,680
of two mechanisms. 
One is, we feel good, and when we feel 

202
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,390
good about things, the bad things in the 
world are less threatening to us. 

203
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,986
But there also can be this reappraisal 
process, is that if we can make fun of 

204
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:58,698
the bad things in the world, make fun of 
the violations, reappraise them into 

205
00:15:58,698 --> 00:16:04,190
benign violations. 
Well then it helps us cope with them, 

206
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,450
because they just don't seem as bad. 
thank you very much. 

207
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:11,860
I want to thank my colleagues in the 
humor research lab. 

208
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:22,733
And my insights from the humor code.
