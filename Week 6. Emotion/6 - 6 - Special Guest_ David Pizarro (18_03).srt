1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,659
Hi, my name is David Pizzaro, I'm a 
psychologist at Cornell University and I 

2
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:12,900
study emotions, especially emotions and 
how they influence judgement. 

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,987
Today I want to talk to you about one of 
those emotions, the emotion of disgust 

4
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:18,625
and how it might influence your thinking 
in surprising ways. 

5
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:24,290
For a long time psychologists have 
pointed to the power of emotions. 

6
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:28,50
In fact emotions are those things that 
motivate us toward action. 

7
00:00:28,50 --> 00:00:31,333
Many times these emotions are things that 
motivate us toward actions that would 

8
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:34,30
keep us alive. 
For instance our strongest emotions, 

9
00:00:34,30 --> 00:00:38,510
emotions like fear are ones that keep us 
from getting close to natural predators. 

10
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,46
There's a reason why we're afraid 
naturally of things like lions and snakes 

11
00:00:43,46 --> 00:00:45,938
and spiders. 
But emotions don't only motivate us to 

12
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:48,590
behave in certain ways like avoiding 
predators. 

13
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,520
They also seem to change the way we think 
about the world. 

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,18
That is when your'e fearful, not only do 
you want to run from the lion, but you're 

15
00:00:55,18 --> 00:00:57,820
more likely to think that there are lions 
everywhere. 

16
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:02,480
And this influence on judgement has some 
interesting effects. 

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,323
What I want to talk to you about today is 
the power that the emotion of disgust 

18
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,520
might have on the way we make our 
judgments. 

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,709
And how a very natural emotion that keeps 
us away from things that might 

20
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:17,40
contaminate us or give us diseases also 
changes the way we think about our 

21
00:01:17,40 --> 00:01:20,734
social, moral, political, and even our 
consumer decisions. 

22
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:26,201
Now, the insight that emotions could even 
be studied systematically probably first 

23
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:30,441
came from Charles Darwin. 
Who wrote a book in the late 1800s 

24
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:36,800
systematically documenting the universal 
nature of many human emotions. 

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,152
Psychologists in the 60s picked up this 
original project of Darwin's and 

26
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:45,572
documented that across the world there 
appeared to be a set of universal basic 

27
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:49,856
emotions and these as I said, are the 
kinds of emotions that were, are around 

28
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:54,280
and universal because they help us adapt 
to our natural environment. 

29
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,450
So for instance, we have fear, surprise, 
disgust, anger. 

30
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,470
All of these are there in the human 
system, in the human mind, in the human 

31
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,150
body because they give us a certain kind 
of survival advantage. 

32
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,90
Disgust is one of these basic universal 
emotions. 

33
00:02:09,90 --> 00:02:12,562
That is no matter where you look, no 
matter what culture you look to, 

34
00:02:12,562 --> 00:02:16,592
somebody, people seem to have this 
natural adversive response to things that 

35
00:02:16,592 --> 00:02:20,24
are gross. 
Things that might contaminate us or give 

36
00:02:20,24 --> 00:02:21,940
us diseases. 
This is a good emotion. 

37
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,408
It keeps our bodies clean, right, disease 
is something that we've had to deal with 

38
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:29,465
throughout most of human history. 
So avoiding disease with this natural 

39
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:34,310
program of disease avoidance, that we 
might call disgust, is a very good thing. 

40
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,992
You can see the origins of this even 
early in infancy. 

41
00:02:36,992 --> 00:02:41,642
if you take a bitter liquid or sour 
liquid and you put it into the mouth of 

42
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:46,592
an infant, a newborn, what you'll see is 
something very much like the full blown 

43
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:49,300
adult disgust face. 
They'll wrinkle up their nose. 

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,980
They'll even protrude their tongue trying 
to get that thing out of their mouth. 

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,328
In fact when we make a disgust response, 
even though we can't see that we're 

46
00:02:57,328 --> 00:03:00,784
sticking out our tongue, we're often 
actually moving our tongue in that same 

47
00:03:00,784 --> 00:03:04,373
way. 
So, one of the things that's very 

48
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:08,326
interesting about disgust and actually 
one of the reasons I started studying it 

49
00:03:08,326 --> 00:03:11,330
was because it's very, very easy to make 
people disgusted. 

50
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,880
Some of the other emotions are hard to 
influence in the laboratory. 

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,490
That is we can bring people in the lab 
and we can try to make them angry. 

52
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,520
We can try to make them afraid with 
various methods. 

53
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,250
But disgust we don't have to try very 
hard. 

54
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:25,378
I'm just going to give you one example of 
a disgusting image I'll just prepare you 

55
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:27,690
in advance that I'm about to show you 
something disgusting. 

56
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,382
Some of you might actually show that same 
emotion face that I just showed you where 

57
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,100
you wrinkle up your nose. 
Right. 

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,195
This is something that we might see in 
any day in, in, in our lives but it's 

59
00:03:38,195 --> 00:03:42,220
something that probably has a profound 
ability to make you feel disgust. 

60
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,820
Some of you might feel it more than 
others. 

61
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,836
And in fact when we look at the sorts of 
things that make us feel disgusted across 

62
00:03:48,836 --> 00:03:53,526
cultures we see a very common pattern. 
As I said, these are things that tend to 

63
00:03:53,526 --> 00:03:56,630
make us sick if we touch them or come 
into contact with them. 

64
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,342
So things like feces, urine, blood, 
vomit, rotten flesh, pus, all of those 

65
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:06,338
things are universal triggers of disgust. 
That is to say although we can override 

66
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:09,80
them sometimes. 
No matter where you look people seem to 

67
00:04:09,80 --> 00:04:11,590
respond with the same reaction. 
And the, it makes sense. 

68
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,900
These things are also things that might 
actually make us sick. 

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,322
They're signs of disease. 
Now, when Darwin was investigating the 

70
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:21,980
emotions, he wrote something that I think 
was very insightful. 

71
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,75
he says here in Tierra del Fuego, a 
native touched with his finger some cold 

72
00:04:26,75 --> 00:04:30,317
preserved meat while I was eating and 
plainly showed disgust at it's softness. 

73
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:34,413
While I felt utter disgust at my food 
being touched by a a naked savage, though 

74
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:37,734
his hands did not appear dirty. 
So one of the things that Darwin is 

75
00:04:37,734 --> 00:04:41,388
pointing out early on is that the same 
disgust reaction that he has, he saw in 

76
00:04:41,388 --> 00:04:43,886
the savage. 
This was an early documentation of the 

77
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:47,540
universe, universal nature of disgust but 
Darwin also points to something 

78
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,78
interesting, that is, that we not only 
feel disgust for things that might 

79
00:04:51,78 --> 00:04:54,500
contaminate us by putting it in our, 
putting it in our mouth, or maybe by 

80
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,96
touching it, but we also feel disgust 
very easily at people, other people, 

81
00:04:58,96 --> 00:05:02,174
people that might be foreign from us. 
And he also points to the fact that 

82
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:06,481
disgust, one of the real important 
features of disgust Is that it works 

83
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:10,430
through contagion. 
To give you an example, if you stand next 

84
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,790
to a lion I might be afraid of the lion 
but I'm not now afraid of you. 

85
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,581
Disgust doesn't work that way. 
If you touch something disgusting, now 

86
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:23,18
that thing has the property of disgust. 
That is, through this association with 

87
00:05:23,18 --> 00:05:26,740
the bad thing. 
That has now been contaminated and I 

88
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,922
don't want to touch it. 
And if you think about it, this is a very 

89
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,140
good thing if what we're trying to avoid 
is disease. 

90
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:36,236
So before we had an explicit theory of 
how germs spread and cause disease, the 

91
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:38,624
emotion of disgust was tracking 
contagion. 

92
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:43,540
The power of contagion is at work a lot 
in, in the emotion of disgust. 

93
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,730
Especially as we navigate our daily 
social moral political lives. 

94
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,410
but also when we make our consumer 
decisions. 

95
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,890
Let me give you an example from one 
study. 

96
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,116
researchers gave individuals a mug and 
asked them, how much do you think this 

97
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:59,460
mug is worth? 
This was compared to a group who were 

98
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,930
just asked, how much do you think this 
mug is worth. 

99
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,806
but we're not given the mug, and it turns 
out in general people think that their 

100
00:06:05,806 --> 00:06:09,641
own, their own things are worth more. 
So if you say how much would you sell 

101
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:12,908
this mug for, how much is worth? 
If I've just given it to you, you'd 

102
00:06:12,908 --> 00:06:16,562
actually think that it's worth more. 
But if I showed you disgusting images 

103
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:19,230
like the one I just showed you before, 
that effect goes away. 

104
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,390
One of the most robust effects, that we 
like things and we value things that are 

105
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,486
our own more than those things that 
belong to others, can be completely wiped 

106
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:31,770
out if we are now feeling disgust when 
evaluating the value of our own product. 

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,661
In another set of studies If products 
that are disgusting touched products that 

108
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:40,968
were not disgusting so in this case a 
product that has to come into close 

109
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,320
contact with the body. 
They used tampons. 

110
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,992
If tampons touched a bag of cookies, mind 
you both of them were closed and they 

111
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:51,870
were clean tampons. 
There was no chance of any contamination 

112
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,350
going on. 
Just the fact that people were disgusted 

113
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,762
slightly by the tampons made them value 
the cookies less. 

114
00:06:58,762 --> 00:07:03,778
Now this property of contagion that we 
can see in consumer decisions extends to 

115
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:07,720
what might be considered a very a much 
more important domain. 

116
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,812
That is we can make you feel disgusted 
not at cookies or a mug, we can make you 

117
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,370
feel disgusted about a person or an 
entire social group. 

118
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,760
This has been used quite effectively and 
quite tragically in many cases. 

119
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,115
One of the best cases comes from World 
War 2 propaganda, where the Germans were 

120
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:27,269
trying to convince people that the, that 
the Jews were filthy, disgusting 

121
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:30,370
individuals in, in part to make it easier 
to kill them. 

122
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,700
So, this comes, this quote comes from a 
Nazi children's book published in 1938. 

123
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,858
Trying to point the children to the 
disgusting, the disgusting features of 

124
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,460
Jewish people. 
It says just look at these guys! 

125
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,600
The louse-infested beards! 
The filthy, protruding ears, those 

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,655
stained fatty clothes. 
Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish 

127
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:50,638
odor. 
If you have a good nose you can smell the 

128
00:07:50,638 --> 00:07:53,387
Jews. 
More recently this very same tactic has 

129
00:07:53,387 --> 00:07:58,430
been used by people who want to convince 
us that homosexuality is bad or immoral. 

130
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,639
So this is taken from an anti-gay 
website, gays are worthy of death for 

131
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,986
their vile sex practices, they're like 
dogs eating their own vomit and sows 

132
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,946
wallowing in their own feces. 
Again, these very low level discussed 

133
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:15,502
properties, pointing to human bodily 
products for instance or, or specific 

134
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:19,854
descriptions of sexual acts get the 
disgust reaction going, and through the 

135
00:08:19,854 --> 00:08:24,2
process of contagion, we tag an 
individual or an entire social group, and 

136
00:08:24,2 --> 00:08:28,516
it gives us a very, very strong avoidance 
and negative response to that group. 

137
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:33,274
Now, one of the questions that my 
colleagues and I wanted to answer was are 

138
00:08:33,274 --> 00:08:38,110
some people just more prone, more 
susceptible, to being convinced by this 

139
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,72
process of contagion. 
And so, one of the things that we wanted 

140
00:08:42,72 --> 00:08:45,712
to look at was, well, maybe some people 
who are more easy to disgust than others 

141
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:49,576
would be more likely to have some kind of 
negative attitudes toward certain social 

142
00:08:49,576 --> 00:08:52,242
groups. 
And we were able to do that by looking 

143
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:57,354
across the population at, simply put, the 
levels of squeamishness that individuals 

144
00:08:57,354 --> 00:08:59,956
have. 
Just as with many other basic universal 

145
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,560
notions, while we all have them, some of 
them have them much stronger than others. 

146
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,340
So in this class, there are many of you 
who when I showed that image had a very, 

147
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,360
very strong response, some of you weren't 
even bothered at all and wondered why I 

148
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,748
bothered to put the picture up. 
We can actually measure this level of 

149
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:18,750
squeamishness using a scale called the 
disgust sensitivity scale and plot people 

150
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,520
along the line of how easily disgusted 
they are in everyday life and how hard to 

151
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,636
disgust they are. 
we do this by asking a series of 

152
00:09:25,636 --> 00:09:28,840
questions. 
Let me give you a couple of examples. 

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,366
Imagine that you were asked this. 
Even if I were hungry I would not drink a 

154
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:36,718
bowl of my favorite soup if it had been 
stirred by a used but thoroughly washed 

155
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:39,153
fly swatter. 
How much do you agree or disagree with 

156
00:09:39,153 --> 00:09:41,770
that statement? 
Or, while you're walking through a tunnel 

157
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,693
under a railroad track, you smell urine. 
Would you be very disgusted or not at all 

158
00:09:45,693 --> 00:09:48,289
disgusted at? 
It turns out that I'm actually very very 

159
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,960
disgusted so it's hard for me to do this 
research. 

160
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,184
But we can plot a score given enough of 
these questions that gives you an overall 

161
00:09:55,184 --> 00:09:58,663
score on how discussed sensitive you are, 
how squeamish you are. 

162
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,810
One of the things that this can do is 
predict your actual behavior. 

163
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,870
So the researchers that came up with the 
scale brought people into the laboratory 

164
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,120
and asked them to do a variety of tasks 
that were disgusting. 

165
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,191
For instance, eat perfectly healthy, in 
fact very nutritious, meal worms but that 

166
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:16,400
nobody eats worms really in the United 
States so they were very disgusting. 

167
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:21,230
or something milder like eat a piece of 
chocolate that's been baked to look like 

168
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,870
a, to look like dog poop. 
it turns out people find, people who are 

169
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,650
very easily disgusted are much less 
likely to do that than people who are not 

170
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,590
easily disgusted. 
So your score on this scale actually 

171
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,790
predicts your actual disgust response and 
your behavior. 

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,885
One of the first things we found was that 
disgust sensitivity, that is level of 

173
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:42,760
squeamishness, seems to predict of all 
things, political orientation. 

174
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,288
As people who are more likely to be 
politically conservative were also more 

175
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:49,892
likely to say they were easily disgusted. 
Another way of saying this though, is 

176
00:10:49,892 --> 00:10:52,918
that people who report being more liberal 
are less easy to disgust. 

177
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,800
You might imagine why one way or the 
other might make more sense. 

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,944
But this is the general relationship. 
And we found this over three, four, five 

179
00:10:59,944 --> 00:11:03,560
different data collections looking at 
different populations. 

180
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,912
Until we finally came to a very very big 
data set at least when speaking about 

181
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:11,944
psychology, we were able to look at 
nearly 30,000 respondents in the United 

182
00:11:11,944 --> 00:11:15,912
States, what you see on this graph is 
that people who are very conservative 

183
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:20,300
there on the right, are much more likely 
to report that they are easily disgusted. 

184
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,870
That's higher numbers there indicate 
their more squeamish. 

185
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,83
And on the other hand, people were very 
liberal or actually less likely to be 

186
00:11:27,83 --> 00:11:30,610
easily disgusted.. 
We found this even though we were able to 

187
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,390
statically control for a variety of 
factors that we know are related both to 

188
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:38,410
disgust sensitivity and to political 
orientation like socioeconomic status, 

189
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,310
income, education levels, religiosity 
even some of the biggest personality 

190
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,600
traits that we know are associated with 
both. 

191
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,119
No matter what we still found a general 
relationship between disgust sensitivity 

192
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:50,660
how easily disgusted you are and your 
political beliefs. 

193
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:54,884
And this actually predicted not just how 
you respond on a one to seven scale of 

194
00:11:54,884 --> 00:11:59,240
how politically conservative you are or 
liberal, but it also seemed to predict 

195
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,810
actually voting behavior. 
That is when we look at state by state 

196
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:06,586
voting results in the 2008 US 
presidential election, what we found was 

197
00:12:06,586 --> 00:12:10,874
that levels of disgust sensitivity in a 
state predicted the margin of victory of 

198
00:12:10,874 --> 00:12:14,83
Obama over McCain. 
That is, states that had, in general, 

199
00:12:14,83 --> 00:12:18,806
higher levels of discussed sensitivity. 
Where, states where McCain actually got 

200
00:12:18,806 --> 00:12:23,805
more votes compared to Obama. 
Now, we were wondering whether this was 

201
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:27,140
maybe just a feature of American 
politics. 

202
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,990
So, we looked across the world. 
Across 121 different countries. 

203
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,140
Here, you see collapsed into a number of 
geographical regions. 

204
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,562
We ask the same kinds of political 
questions and discuss sensitivity 

205
00:12:37,562 --> 00:12:40,64
questions. 
And what we were able to see was these 

206
00:12:40,64 --> 00:12:43,712
numbers indicate the strength of the 
relationship the correlation between 

207
00:12:43,712 --> 00:12:46,180
discuss sensitivity and political 
orientation. 

208
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,540
What you see is no matter where you look 
across the world the samae result 

209
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,430
emerges. 
That is by enlarged the more likely you 

210
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,790
are to be easily disgusted the more 
likely you are to be politically 

211
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,469
conservative. 
Or again you are liberal if you are not 

212
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:02,94
usually discussed it. 
Now this is a fairly small effect this 

213
00:13:02,94 --> 00:13:06,460
accounts for a small part of why we might 
have political beliefs. 

214
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,486
But nonetheless it's interesting because 
most people might not think that how 

215
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:14,512
easily disgusted they are by things like 
on flush toilets or speak to strangers 

216
00:13:14,512 --> 00:13:17,256
soda. 
Might actually predict who they vote for 

217
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:20,487
in a presidential election. 
One of the questions that we had was 

218
00:13:20,487 --> 00:13:24,605
whether we could actually shift people's 
attitudes towards social groups and moral 

219
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,890
and political attitudes in particular by 
making them disgusted. 

220
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,720
So what we did at Cornell in our lab was 
bring participants into the lab. 

221
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,790
And asked them to fill out a series of 
questionnaires. 

222
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,430
In this particular study we asked them to 
evaluate certain social groups. 

223
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,520
We knew that there was a strong link 
between homosexuality and disgust. 

224
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,680
Because of the way that many people who 
are anti homosexual talk about the sex 

225
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,350
act and use disgust in order to convince 
people. 

226
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,190
So we wanted to see if if making people 
disgusted in a completely unrelated way. 

227
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,965
That is we weren't making them disgusted 
about sex or anything like that. 

228
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:59,900
We were making them disgusted with a 
fould odor. 

229
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,255
Essentially we sprayed with a really 
nasty odor on every other day, and we 

230
00:14:03,255 --> 00:14:06,665
brought participants into the lab, and 
asked them what they thought about 

231
00:14:06,665 --> 00:14:10,192
certain social groups. 
African-Americans, the elderly, 

232
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:15,336
immigrants, gay men, and lesbian women. 
And what we found was, that the foul odor 

233
00:14:15,336 --> 00:14:20,16
had a particularly strong effect In fact, 
the only effect we found, was that it 

234
00:14:20,16 --> 00:14:22,930
made people negatively evaluate gay men 
more. 

235
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,146
So that is, on the days when people had 
to evaluate gay men, where there was a 

236
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:31,158
foul smell in the room, they were more 
likely to find, to report greater 

237
00:14:31,158 --> 00:14:34,576
negative attitudes. 
Here, this is plotting on a feeling 

238
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:37,813
thermometer. 
That is, from zero to 100, how warmly, or 

239
00:14:37,813 --> 00:14:43,700
coldly, do you feel toward gay men. 
Other labs have also looked at these 

240
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,670
differences using physiological measures, 
you might wonder self report, that is if 

241
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,660
you ask, if I ask you how easily 
disgusted you are, maybe you're not so 

242
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,310
accurate. 
But if I hook you up to physiological 

243
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:59,275
measures, measures of heart beat, and 
skin conductance that we know are rough 

244
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,813
measures of arrousal, and show you 
disgusting images We find the same 

245
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:05,322
general effect. 
People who report being greater 

246
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,738
conservatives, more likely to be 
politically conservative, are more 

247
00:15:08,738 --> 00:15:11,950
physiologically aroused when presented 
with disgusting images. 

248
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,539
Liberals are less physically aroused. 
In particular, attitudes towards 

249
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:22,209
homosexuality and abortion were the ones 
that predicted more, most, whether or not 

250
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:27,474
people would be aroused by disgusting 
images that had nothing to do with those 

251
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:31,336
issues such as dog feces. 
Well, there's another way to kick in this 

252
00:15:31,336 --> 00:15:34,510
feeling that there might be contamination 
in the environment. 

253
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,536
So discussed is a particularly powerful 
way to do this, but discussed again, is 

254
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,40
in the service of keeping us from getting 
sick. 

255
00:15:41,40 --> 00:15:44,442
You can show similar effects by just 
reminding people that there is disease 

256
00:15:44,442 --> 00:15:47,792
prevelant in the environment. 
And a number of researchers have used 

257
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:52,136
this disease avoidance As a manipulation. 
We thought, well, perhaps just reminding 

258
00:15:52,136 --> 00:15:56,96
people that there's contamination in the 
environment might get them to change 

259
00:15:56,96 --> 00:16:00,169
their political and moral attitudes. 
So, we conducted a study where all we did 

260
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:04,327
was remind people that the swine flu was, 
was prevalent in Cornell and that they 

261
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:07,878
should sanitize their hands. 
In one case we explicitly told them that 

262
00:16:07,878 --> 00:16:11,30
they should sanitize their hands. 
And asked them a number of, of questions 

263
00:16:11,30 --> 00:16:13,410
about their moral beliefs and their 
political beliefs. 

264
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:17,370
In another case we actually just asked 
them to fill out a questionnaire, either 

265
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,444
next to a hand sanitizing station or not. 
And what we found is, was that a simple 

266
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:25,540
reminder to wash your hands actually had 
a pretty strong effect on your moral 

267
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,605
beliefs. 
In this case beliefs about sexually weird 

268
00:16:29,605 --> 00:16:32,900
but harmless practices. 
Let me give you an example. 

269
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,594
so we asked people, imagine that Joe is 
house sitting for his grandmother and Joe 

270
00:16:38,594 --> 00:16:43,378
invites his girlfriend over and they have 
sex on his grandmother's bed. 

271
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:47,470
Now, if I'd just reminded you that you 
should wash your hands because of the 

272
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,628
swine flu, you're more likely to find 
that to be morally wrong that if I had to 

273
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:53,790
be. 
When we asked people to report their 

274
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,78
political orientation in their same set 
of studies we also found general effect 

275
00:16:58,78 --> 00:17:01,662
that simply reminding people to wash 
their hands had a change in how 

276
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:05,336
conservative there reported being 
politically conservative. 

277
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:09,496
So a simple reminder of of disgust or of 
contamination can change our consumer 

278
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:12,665
decisions. 
It can change our political decisions, it 

279
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:15,910
can change our moral decisions. 
This is a case in which disgust is not 

280
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,528
simply preventing us from eating things 
that might make us sick but it's having a 

281
00:17:19,528 --> 00:17:22,900
fairly profound influence on our social, 
political, moral judgements. 

282
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,438
The question that I want to leave you 
with is now that we know this, we can 

283
00:17:26,438 --> 00:17:30,281
finally get to the point where we can ask 
when should emotions influence our 

284
00:17:30,281 --> 00:17:33,424
thinking? 
Science isn't particularly well-suited to 

285
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:36,723
answer this question. 
All we can do is point out how emotions 

286
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,31
work. 
How emotions can influence the way we 

287
00:17:39,31 --> 00:17:43,215
make decisions and judgements. 
But we have to now ask the additional 

288
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:48,240
question, now that we know that, should 
disgust shape the way, for instance, you 

289
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,644
will. 
Who you vote for in the political, in the 

290
00:17:51,644 --> 00:17:56,64
political elections, what you vote for 
about gay rights, or what you buy at the 

291
00:17:56,64 --> 00:18:03,293
grocery store. 
Thank you very much.
