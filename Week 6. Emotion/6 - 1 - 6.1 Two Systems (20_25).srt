1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:07,783
And the topic of this section is emotions.
A guy goes to his mother and says, mother

2
00:00:07,783 --> 00:00:12,397
after 40 years, I finally decide to get
married.

3
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:15,420
And the mother is so happy.
She's just filled with joy.

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,713
And she said, why don't you bring your
future wife to dinner?

5
00:00:18,713 --> 00:00:22,498
And the guy said, that's wonderful.
I'll bring her over Saturday night.

6
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:26,860
But he says, you know, over the last two
years mother, I dated two other women and

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:31,150
I'm still friends with all of them, and
we're, why don't I bring all three women

8
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:35,308
to dinner and why don't you meet all three
women and then let's see if we could

9
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,637
guess, if you could guess which is the one
I'm going to marry.

10
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,780
The mother said, that's great.
He brings all three women to dinner.

11
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,418
His mother talks to one.
She talked to the second.

12
00:00:44,418 --> 00:00:47,855
She talked to the third.
After about an hour, she points to one of

13
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:50,430
them and she said, I know which one.
It's this one.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,863
This is the one you're going to marry.
And the guy is amazed.

15
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:56,791
He looks at this mother and said, mother,
how well do you know me?

16
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,935
How well do you understand me?
I loved all of these three women.

17
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,330
I'm friends with all of them.
I appreciate all of them.

18
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:06,166
But indeed, this is the one that I'm going
to spend all of my life with.

19
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,837
What gave it away?
What gave it away?

20
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:13,354
And the mother looks at him and she says,
it's the only one I hate.

21
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:18,155
What is it about emotions?
It turns out there are two sides to our

22
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:21,885
decision making.
There's the rational side and there's the

23
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:24,625
emotional side.
And what's interesting is that not only do

24
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,537
we have these two sides.
They don't simply add up.

25
00:01:27,538 --> 00:01:33,080
Sometimes when emotions are evoked they
take over and they basically eliminate our

26
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,860
rational side.
And in this section we will think about

27
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:42,555
how emotions actually work, when they
overpower us, under what conditions, and

28
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:47,485
how do they get us to make either bad
decisions and sometimes even good

29
00:01:47,485 --> 00:01:50,380
decisions.
[music].

30
00:01:54,208 --> 00:02:13,587
Emotions we all have them, we all
experience them.

31
00:02:13,587 --> 00:02:20,737
The question is, what do we know about
them and how do they actually work and how

32
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:28,373
they influence our decision making?
So Pascal said, we arrive at the truth not

33
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:34,006
by reason alone, but also by the heart.
And this is the idea that we have these

34
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:39,288
two separate inputs into decision making.
We have an input from our cognitive system

35
00:02:39,288 --> 00:02:42,060
and we have an input from the limbic
system.

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,360
In very general, simplistic, maybe
oversimplistic terms, we think about the

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,125
brain as having two systems.
We think about the system that is internal

38
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:53,870
to the brain and the inside of the brain
that is more the emotional system.

39
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:57,347
And then we have the neocortex that
surrounds it, which is more of the

40
00:02:57,347 --> 00:03:00,605
thoughtful system.
And what's interesting is that those

41
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:05,025
systems do have some kind of separate
inputs, separate outputs, and separate

42
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:08,656
ways of, of thinking.
So, the way that our decisions, we arrive

43
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:13,072
at them at the end of the day, is not just
the two of them together, but it kind of

44
00:03:13,072 --> 00:03:16,944
separate from the two systems.
And lots of theorizing have been going on

45
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:21,144
and something called system one or system
two, the emotional system, the cognitive

46
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,686
system.
But for today, I want to just concentrate

47
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:27,050
on the emotional system, and say what do
we know about the system?

48
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,240
How does it operate?
How does it give us signals?

49
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,898
And now, from an evolutionary perspective,
the way to think about that, is to think

50
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:39,215
about.
Imagine you were in the jungle 100,000

51
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:42,832
years ago.
And imagine you saw a tiger approaching.

52
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:47,478
What did you, would you want to do?
Would you want to pop up your spreadsheet

53
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:50,250
and look at the cost and benefits?
Should you run, should you stay?

54
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:54,167
Of course not.
You want a system that would take over.

55
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:58,577
You want a system that would give you a
quick command and get you to run as fast

56
00:03:58,577 --> 00:04:03,404
as you can without thinking.
And one way to think about this thing is

57
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:08,010
as if it's an executable program.
As if there's a tiger, presses a button in

58
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,650
your brain, that says turn around, run as
fast as you can.

59
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:15,190
Don't think about it.
And in fact, it's useful to think about

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,358
the emotional system in that way, that it
takes inputs from the outside world, and

61
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,064
gets to execute the command.
Whether it's about running or fighting or

62
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,620
procreating, that are not really dependent
on the cognitive system.

63
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,829
Which means that when we get an input from
our emotional system, we've just execute

64
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:37,450
something as fast as we can without
thinking about it to a high degree.

65
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,750
And of'course, we are basically limbic
animals.

66
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,900
We are but we share with the rest of the
animal kingdom, is our limbic system.

67
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,956
This internal part of the brain is
incredibly similar with us and mice and

68
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,890
rats and all across the, the animal
kingdom.

69
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,424
Its the cognitive system that separates
us.

70
00:04:56,425 --> 00:05:00,546
So, much of the animal kingdom, but they
limbic, the central part of the brain.

71
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:04,206
The emotional part of the brain is
something that is very, very similar to

72
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:07,836
the rest of the, the animals.
And because of that, we can study that not

73
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:11,060
just in human beings, but in all kinds of
other animals as well.

74
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,420
So, this is what has stayed with us for
longer time.

75
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,714
It's something that started our
evolutionary, evolutionary progress.

76
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:21,120
It's something that we share with the rest
of the animals.

77
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,410
Something that is incredibly basic.
In fact, if you thought about what's more

78
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,233
basic to the human experience?
Emotion or cognition?

79
00:05:29,234 --> 00:05:33,660
Cognition separates us to a higher degree
from the animal kingdom but emotion is,

80
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,694
has been with us for a longer time.
It's what's really us in a deep rooted

81
00:05:38,694 --> 00:05:42,057
way.
With this understanding of emotions, it's

82
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:45,487
something that gets us to act in a
particular way.

83
00:05:45,488 --> 00:05:47,987
You see a tiger and you just start
running.

84
00:05:47,988 --> 00:05:52,356
You can ask yourself, why do we even have,
have to have the feeling of an emotion,

85
00:05:52,356 --> 00:05:55,135
what's called qualia, the feeling of the
emotion?

86
00:05:55,135 --> 00:05:56,690
Why?
Why can't we just run?

87
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:59,748
Why do we need to know that there are
emotions?

88
00:05:59,748 --> 00:06:05,450
Why you would need to feel those emotions.
And the theory for that is that emotions

89
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:09,409
are not good for that moment.
The moment you see a lion you just want to

90
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,887
start running.
You don't have to feel anything.

91
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:16,272
But it's about teaching us for the future.
That the quality of the thing about the

92
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:19,210
feeling of the emotion comes for planning
for the future.

93
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,902
So, once you've done a few things, and got
some very negative feedback.

94
00:06:23,902 --> 00:06:27,400
It didn't work out very well.
This part of the jungle was dangerous this

95
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,988
and so on.
Now, the feeling that this emotion is

96
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:34,100
going to stay with you and you're going to
be able to have a lesson from it.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:37,481
And when you plan for the future, you're
going to hopefully do things in a better

98
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,057
way.
So, what I wanted you to do now is, I

99
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:45,685
wanted to think about your own experience
of emotions, and you had many of those,

100
00:06:45,685 --> 00:06:50,977
and to think to yourself about what is
special about emotions, how emotions

101
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:54,958
actually work.
What can you say from just reflecting on

102
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:59,402
emotions about how they operate, how long
they stay and so on?

103
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:04,602
If you think about it, you, you realize
that emotions are not usual feelings or

104
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:07,931
thoughts.
They are much more primitive.

105
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:11,668
You realize that they are fast.
You realize that they are executed

106
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:16,754
automatically based on the environment.
You realize that they could be moderated,

107
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:21,190
probably by cognitive processes.
The first thing that comes around could be

108
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,205
perceived very differently, depending on
what you're thinking on at the time.

109
00:07:25,206 --> 00:07:29,343
Are you in the a comfortable mindset?
Are you in an aroused mindset?

110
00:07:29,343 --> 00:07:32,293
And so on.
And you also probably realize that they

111
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,495
are transitory.
And the transitory part is actually

112
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:40,313
incredibly important because when
something happens and you feel an emotion,

113
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:44,973
you probably feel at that moment that the
emotion would last for a long time.

114
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:49,998
But the fact is, that the emotion would
often go, go down in a faster speed than

115
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:53,329
you might anticipate.
And this, by the way, happens for both

116
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:57,017
good things and bad things.
So, as somebody who was eh, badly injured

117
00:07:57,017 --> 00:08:01,573
a long time ago, if you asked me at early
days of my injury how long do I think this

118
00:08:01,573 --> 00:08:05,794
would last and how long would I feel
miserable, I would probably think that I

119
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:10,015
would feel miserable for a really, really
long time and it would not get much

120
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:12,646
better.
In fact, over time, it did got better,

121
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:16,293
better than I expected.
Similarly, when you talk to somebody that

122
00:08:16,293 --> 00:08:19,420
had something happy, happening.
Winning the lottery, maybe.

123
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,820
You ask them how long will things be
happy.

124
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,650
They think it would be long, for a long
time.

125
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,896
In fact, it'll be happy but for shorter
time than they expect.

126
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:31,242
There is a lot of experiments on this, by
the way.

127
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:34,050
Dan Gilbert at Harvard has done many of
those.

128
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:39,405
It's about our inability to predict how
the future would work in terms of our

129
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:42,842
adaptation.
So, for example, in a standard experiment,

130
00:08:42,842 --> 00:08:47,417
he asked people at, at Harvard about how
they would feel if they got tenure or not.

131
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:51,714
So, at some point, professors are up for
tenure and then the university decides if

132
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:55,702
to give us a job for life or not.
And people predict that if they get

133
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:59,646
tenure, they'll be really, really happy
and they will be really, really happy for

134
00:08:59,646 --> 00:09:02,210
a long time.
And if they didn't get tenure they will be

135
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,577
really, really miserable and really,
really miserable for a long time.

136
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,818
What happens?
On the day that people are told that they

137
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:11,467
got it, they're happy.
On the day that they're told they didn't

138
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:15,110
get it, they're unhappy.
But then quite quickly, much quicker than

139
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,390
people anticipate, they get back to the
standards of life, they get adjusted to

140
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,770
it.
The same thing happens with people who are

141
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,060
moving.
People who are moving from Chicago to

142
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,861
California.
Think, oh if I only move to California,

143
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:32,099
where the weather is so good, I will be
happy and I'll be happy for a long time.

144
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:36,195
And people who move from California to
Chicago say, if I only move to Chicago,

145
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:40,419
where it's cold and miserable in the
winter, I'll be miserable and be miserable

146
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,002
for really long time.
People do get their initial happiness or

147
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,777
this happiness but then they go back to
it.

148
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:54,415
This also by the way, happens with dating.
People think that when I break up with my

149
00:09:54,415 --> 00:09:59,590
girlfriend or boyfriend or get a divorce,
I'll be really miserable and this misery

150
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:03,376
would last a long time.
It turns out that misery is much more

151
00:10:03,376 --> 00:10:07,789
short lived than people expect.
There's lots of things about emotions.

152
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:12,037
One of the things is that they are
temporary and we don't think of them as

153
00:10:12,037 --> 00:10:15,433
temporary.
The other thing that is incredibly

154
00:10:15,433 --> 00:10:19,406
important is that when they come up, they
take over.

155
00:10:19,406 --> 00:10:23,430
They don't just add to another component.
It's not that you think and have

156
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,030
cognition, they seem to be taking over.
And in fact, that's what you would want

157
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,120
them to do if you designed emotion as an
escape, as an escape plan.

158
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,864
So, let's think a little bit about how
emotions over take cognition.

159
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:43,045
And we decided to test this in as many,
many ways that you can think about testing

160
00:10:43,045 --> 00:10:46,584
it.
You can think about testing it when people

161
00:10:46,584 --> 00:10:50,613
are hungry or afraid or thirsty, or people
are curious.

162
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:54,972
Where something around the world, either
our internal physiology, or something

163
00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:59,662
external, is influencing our emotions.
Our emotion system starts working and we

164
00:10:59,662 --> 00:11:04,917
can say how much they take over.
We decide to do it with sexual arousal.

165
00:11:04,918 --> 00:11:09,538
And the reason we decide to do it with
sexual arousal is that sexual arousal is

166
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:14,506
incredibly basic to the human experience,
people have lots of experience with it,

167
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:19,134
and, and it's also, a consequence for many
important decisions on life.

168
00:11:19,134 --> 00:11:22,550
We have crimes of passion, we have
advertising using sex.

169
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,307
So it's really around us in a big, a big
way.

170
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:35,173
[inaudible].
>> Viewer discretion is advised.

171
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:40,517
In the upcoming clip, you will be exposed
to potentially explicit descriptions of

172
00:11:40,517 --> 00:11:45,189
sexual behavior, risk taking, immoral
acts, and the surprising tendency of

173
00:11:45,189 --> 00:11:48,578
mankind to shift priorities when sexually
aroused.

174
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:52,935
If you are sensitive to a conversation and
imagery of a sexual nature, you may not

175
00:11:52,935 --> 00:11:55,859
want to watch this clip.
[inaudible].

176
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:02,492
So we wanted to understand how is the
emotional state of being aroused

177
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:08,118
influencing people's decision making.
So, to do that we looked at three

178
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:11,900
behaviors.
We looked at, we looked at preferences for

179
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,576
sexual behaviors, what kind of sexual
behaviors would people like to engage in

180
00:12:17,576 --> 00:12:20,961
or not.
We looked at willingness to take a risk,

181
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:24,617
mostly the sexual domain wearing condoms
and so on.

182
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:30,720
And we finally looked at the willingness
of men to engage in morally dubious type

183
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,592
behaviors.
What, to what extent were they willing to

184
00:12:34,592 --> 00:12:39,520
lie and exaggerate in order to get women
to go into bed with them.

185
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,957
And the procedure, basically, was very
simple.

186
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,130
We had what we called a cold state, an
unemotional state.

187
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,615
This was the control group.
In that control group, people sat in front

188
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:55,566
of a laptop and answered questions.
And the questions were about, how likely

189
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,972
are you to be interested in engaging in
all kinds of sexual activities.

190
00:12:59,973 --> 00:13:07,597
Ranging from kissing to having sex with
somebody you hated, to things that are

191
00:13:07,597 --> 00:13:14,219
kind of on the outskirts of quirkiness.
Things that were you, are not part of what

192
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:19,763
we think of as standard sex, like contacts
with animals and urination and other

193
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:22,474
things.
So, with the whole range of sexual

194
00:13:22,474 --> 00:13:27,580
practices and we ask people, when you're
sexually aroused, how likely are you to be

195
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,500
interested in engaging in all of those
things.

196
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,905
And people answered those questions.
Then the second question was about risk

197
00:13:34,905 --> 00:13:37,390
taking.
We asked questions about condom use.

198
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,278
If, if you went into a room with a girl at
night and you were both halfly undressed

199
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:45,701
and all of a sudden you realized you don't
have a condom.

200
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:50,519
Would you stop things and go to a pharmacy
to get the condom or would you continue

201
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:54,387
having sex without a condom.
We asked lots of questions like that.

202
00:13:54,388 --> 00:13:57,650
And finally we asked questions about
immoral activities.

203
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:03,026
And we asked, to what extent would you go
as a man, to what extent would you go to

204
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:07,667
try get women to have sex with you.
Would you buy them a drink?

205
00:14:07,668 --> 00:14:10,837
Would you try and get them drunk?
Would you give them drugs?

206
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:15,074
Would you tell them you love them even if
they don't, if you, if you, if you don't,

207
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:17,990
would you try and coerce them physically
and so on?

208
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,346
So, we had the whole range of these
activities.

209
00:14:20,346 --> 00:14:22,650
So, as I told you, we had the cold
condition.

210
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,867
We had the condition which people just sat
there and answer the question.

211
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:33,776
And base on those answers, you would say
that people would, eh, not interested in

212
00:14:33,776 --> 00:14:40,492
any of our quirky sexual behaviors.
They were always going to wear condoms and

213
00:14:40,492 --> 00:14:46,910
they were not going to be deceitful and
egregiously unethical to women.

214
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:49,550
Eh, when they were trying to get them to
have sex with them.

215
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,310
So, people look quite fantastic in that
regard.

216
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,110
But then we took the same men and
sometimes different men and we gave them

217
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,751
the same computer interface.
But before they started answering, some

218
00:15:02,751 --> 00:15:06,690
pictures of nudity came about.
We asked the group of undergraduate

219
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:10,616
students to pick the kind of pornography
that other students would like.

220
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:15,879
And these pictures started appearing.
And in addition to that, we asked them to

221
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,848
self stimulate.
We gave them instructions of sit in you

222
00:15:19,848 --> 00:15:26,078
room alone, get a towel, as the picture
start appearing start stimulating yourself

223
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,774
with one hand and put the computer such
that you can operate with only one, one

224
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:33,955
hand.
And then, as we're going through this

225
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:37,660
self-stimulation process.
We asked them to indicate how aroused they

226
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:40,812
were.
And once the arousal reached a level of

227
00:15:40,812 --> 00:15:44,000
about 75, 80% of the total arousal
possible.

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,650
Between not aroused at all, to coming.
Once it arrived that level, we asked them

229
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:55,880
to try to maintain that level of arousal,
and the questions start to pop again.

230
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,640
So, now the questions popped out and they
were asked, how would you behave when you

231
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,957
arouse?
But now they were also aroused.

232
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,035
So think about it.
Both groups were asked to predict how they

233
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:11,160
would behave.
What sexual activities would they enjoy,

234
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,547
condom use, and misbehavior to women?
How do we behave when aroused?

235
00:16:16,548 --> 00:16:19,656
But the first group were not aroused, the
second group aroused.

236
00:16:19,657 --> 00:16:23,540
And again we have to remember that
undergrads experience arousal quite

237
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,576
quickly, quite often.
So, this is not something that they do not

238
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:29,477
have experience with.
It's something they have experience with.

239
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:32,214
But nevertheless, they were dramatic
differences.

240
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:38,492
In terms of the preferences the people who
were aroused found everything more

241
00:16:38,492 --> 00:16:40,893
exciting.
Legal and illegal.

242
00:16:40,893 --> 00:16:47,325
Everything, every possible activity was
much more exciting.

243
00:16:47,326 --> 00:16:54,626
In terms of safe behavior, people who are
aroused, were not as interested in getting

244
00:16:54,626 --> 00:17:00,902
condoms and acting safe in a sexual way.
And finally, in terms of misbehaving, so

245
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:06,629
with women in ethical way the people who
were in a cold state said I would never do

246
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:12,227
any of those, people in a hot state said,
yes I could easily see myself doing that.

247
00:17:12,228 --> 00:17:17,967
So, what we have here is that despite this
being a common experience, when we have to

248
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:23,477
predict how would we behave when we are
aroused, we don't predict it quite well.

249
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:25,880
And we're aroused, all of a sudden, we
change.

250
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,502
We change as human beings.
All of a sudden, what we want and what we

251
00:17:29,502 --> 00:17:32,955
don't want is not the same.
We look differently at the future, we look

252
00:17:32,955 --> 00:17:35,510
differently at risk, we look differently
at morality.

253
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:40,859
In essence, our desire takes over.
Our thinking goes away.

254
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,964
But not only did, does that happen, but we
also mispredict the extent this would

255
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,540
happen.
So, this suggests for example, that if you

256
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:55,216
think to yourself oh, I'll go to a party
and then if I ever get sexually aroused, I

257
00:17:55,216 --> 00:17:58,640
will go and get a condom.
You're doing that in a state in which

258
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,159
you're cold, in which you're unaroused.
What are the odds that when you actually

259
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,407
get to that state, this will be the state
of your mind and your set of preferences?

260
00:18:07,408 --> 00:18:11,290
Very unlikely.
So, in fact we have to understand how we

261
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,865
become different people when we get
aroused and how we need to account for

262
00:18:15,865 --> 00:18:20,693
that, how we need to make sure that our
behaviors are consistent with that.

263
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:24,429
So you can either think about maybe you
don't want to get to a state of arousal,

264
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,906
or maybe you have to recognize the fact
that by the time you get to a state of

265
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:31,908
arousal, you would be a different person.
Maybe you will want to have a condom with

266
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:34,681
you.
By the way, there's a very troubling

267
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:39,994
result in the US, where you have a lot of
young people who are signing all kinds of

268
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:44,922
pledges to not have sexual relationships
and what you find is that the rate of

269
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:50,158
sexually transmitted disease among this
group is actually very high, sometimes

270
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:53,817
higher than the people who don't take this
pledge.

271
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:55,982
And why?
Because the people who are taking the

272
00:18:55,982 --> 00:19:00,023
pledge are also not taking a condom.
And they say, oh yes, yes, I can always

273
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:02,610
resist the urges and I would always behave
well.

274
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,910
When they get to, in that situation they
can't behave very well.

275
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:12,000
And if they don't have a condom, this is
very they're going to actually act in a

276
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,118
very risky way.
This, by the way, I should point out is

277
00:19:16,118 --> 00:19:21,694
not about forgiving people who commit all
kinds of crimes of passion.

278
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,380
If you and I sat in a jury and there was
somebody who committed some kind of

279
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,840
passion, crime of passion, whether it's
sexual or physical or some other approach,

280
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,832
it's true that from our cold state we
would not be able to understand their hot

281
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:40,348
state.
And it's true that if they, somehow the

282
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:44,971
court procedure would get us to experience
the hot state, all of a sudden we would

283
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:49,590
understand better what was causing that
person to act to a much higher degree.

284
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,418
But understanding that, to an even higher
degree, and understanding how emotion

285
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:59,281
changes, people doesn't necessarily mean
we should just accept it all the time.

286
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:02,157
People are still responsible for their
actions.

287
00:20:02,158 --> 00:20:07,000
But when we design interventions, and we
design educational programs and so on, we

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,690
need to understand the extent to which
emotion changes us and the extent in which

289
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:16,240
it changes us without us understanding how
effective it will be and how big the

290
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,509
difference will be.
