00:00:00,25 --> 00:00:02,932
[MUSIC] And now, teaching kids about 
money. 

2
00:00:02,932 --> 00:00:06,84
Economics correspondent Paul Solmon has 
our story. 

3
00:00:06,84 --> 00:00:12,562
It's part of his ongoing reporting, 
making sense of financial news. 

4
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:13,395
[MUSIC] 

5
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:16,603
 >> Oh, oh, hi. 
Welcome to Sesame Street. 

6
00:00:16,603 --> 00:00:20,477
Oh, look what Elmo has. 
His very own dollar. 

7
00:00:20,477 --> 00:00:22,892
 >> A new financial literacy initiative from 

8
00:00:22,892 --> 00:00:28,394
Sesame Street. 
Money tips for tots starting with saving. 

9
00:00:28,394 --> 00:00:36,934
[MUSIC] If Elmo's going to save, that 
would distinguish him from a host of 

10
00:00:36,934 --> 00:00:44,132
grown up Americans. 
More than a third of them have a mere 

11
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:50,520
$1,000 or less stocked away. 
In total, 29% of us have reported not 

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,660
saving 1 penny for retirement. 
Related perhaps, we can't calculate our 

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,48
way out of a paper bag. 
Get this. 

14
00:01:01,48 --> 00:01:05,536
Americans 50 or older were asked, suppose 
you had $100 in a savings account, and 

15
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:12,206
the interest rate was 2% per year. 
After five years, would you have more 

16
00:01:12,206 --> 00:01:17,585
than $102, exactly $102, or less than 
$102? 

17
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:22,386
2% interest, five years. 
What portion of the country didn't know 

18
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:25,632
that more was the blindingly right 
answer? 

19
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:29,752
Half. 
Might explain why 1.5 million Americans 

20
00:01:29,752 --> 00:01:34,155
filed for bankruptcy last year alone. 
No clue. 

21
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:35,567
No cushion. 

22
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:39,536
 >> The toughest concept is really the idea 
of starting early around financial 

23
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:43,652
education, and particularly the concept 
of saving. 

24
00:01:43,652 --> 00:01:45,860
 >> Because, says Jeanette Betancourt of 

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,130
Sesame Workshop, saving is self 
controlled with which we all wrestle. 

26
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:53,6
 >> So the way you can start with young 

27
00:01:53,6 --> 00:01:57,177
children is identify something that they 
would want. 

28
00:01:57,177 --> 00:02:01,272
And saying that you can't have it 
immediately, because it's something that 

29
00:02:01,272 --> 00:02:04,421
we have to build towards. 
[MUSIC] 

30
00:02:04,421 --> 00:02:07,685
 >> In Elmo's case, that something is a hotly 

31
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:13,849
hyped, irresistible object. 
[MUSIC] A stupendous ball. 

32
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:15,431
[MUSIC] 

33
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,710
 >> Yeah, $5. 

34
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,810
 >> Since commerce on Sesame Street runs on a 
purely cash basis, if you want a 

35
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:31,200
stupendous ball, $5 a piece, and you've 
only got, say $1, you can't borrow. 

36
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,20
You have to save up for it. 
Tough sledding for Elmo, or even the 

37
00:02:35,20 --> 00:02:39,638
street hardened Grover, age six or so. 
How hard is it for you personally to save 

38
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:43,750
instead of spending your money right away 
on something you want? 

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,42
 >> We are not born knowing all these things. 

40
00:02:46,42 --> 00:02:51,844
No, no, I, I had to learn them from my 
friends, and and my Mommy and my Daddy. 

41
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:53,246
They taught me a lot. 

42
00:02:53,246 --> 00:02:57,780
 >> Sometimes people do this test with kids 
your age. 

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,9
They say, I'll give you a marshmallow 
now, or if you wait a little while, I'll 

44
00:03:03,9 --> 00:03:07,685
give you two marshmallows. 
But only if you wait. 

45
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,310
 >> Two marshmallows. 

46
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,672
 >> Would it be hard to wait? 

47
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,944
 >> Would be very hard to wait. 

48
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:15,378
Yes. 
I think, you know, you know, just looking 

49
00:03:15,378 --> 00:03:19,562
at this marshmallow right now makes me 
want that marshmallow right now. 

50
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,740
 >> Leaving aside the dubious charms of the 

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:25,634
food stuff, the marshmallow test is 
actually among the most famous and 

52
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,704
replicated in the history of psychology. 

53
00:03:29,704 --> 00:03:32,115
 >> There's a marshmallow. 
You can either wait and I'll bring you 

54
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:35,274
back another one, so you can have two, or 
you can eat it now. 

55
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,252
 >> I want two. 

56
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:37,920
 >> Okay, I'll be back. 

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,300
 >> The self control experiment was first run 

58
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,20
on 600 preschoolers at Stanford 
University in 1972. 

59
00:03:45,20 --> 00:03:49,375
Most woof down the little pillow of 
pleasure, but 1 3rd delayed gratification 

60
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,116
long enough to get another. 

61
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:52,321
 >> You get two. 
You can eat it. 

62
00:03:52,321 --> 00:03:52,515
 >> Follow up research found. 

63
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:55,543
 >> You can eat them now. 

64
00:03:55,543 --> 00:04:00,371
 >> That the more temperate types had higher 

65
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:06,610
SAT scores as teens. 
More recently, an ongoing study of a 

66
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,642
thousand random New Zealanders from birth 
to now their 30s, yields even stronger 

67
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,850
findings. 

68
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,516
 >> Those children have become the thousand 
most studied people in the world. 

69
00:04:17,516 --> 00:04:20,491
 >> Stunningly, their self control or lack of 

70
00:04:20,491 --> 00:04:26,945
it by age 3 has almost perfectly 
predicted their future prosperity. 

71
00:04:26,945 --> 00:04:28,854
Duke Professor Terry Moffet. 

72
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:33,614
 >> So, the children who are very low self 
control are in deep financial trouble by 

73
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:37,167
their 30s. 
Those who are very high self control are 

74
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:41,188
doing really well, they're entrepreneurs, 
they've got retirement accounts. 

75
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:44,667
They, they own their own homes and those 
that are average self control their right 

76
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,215
in the middle. 

77
00:04:46,215 --> 00:04:50,655
 >> Does it correlate with their initial 
socioeconomic status? 

78
00:04:50,655 --> 00:04:53,130
 >> Self control is clearly more important 

79
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:58,530
than the socioeconomic status of one's 
family, the amount of money that one had 

80
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,230
growing up. 
and it's more important than school 

81
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,942
grades, academic achievement and it's 
more important than scores on 

82
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,268
intelligence tests. 

83
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:13,883
 >> Says fellow Duke Professor Dan Ariely, 
there is no more crucial struggle than 

84
00:05:13,883 --> 00:05:20,600
the rational long-term self against all 
the competing short-term players within. 

85
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,165
 >> Saving, good for the future. 

86
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:25,680
Right now, I want something else. 
Exercising, good for the future. 

87
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,220
Right now, I want to eat another slice of 
pizza. 

88
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,282
Think about sex, right? 
You can, you can think about the amount 

89
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:36,187
of political leaders who've taken 
dramatic falls over immediate 

90
00:05:36,187 --> 00:05:38,279
temptations. 

91
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,584
 >> As for Sesame Street's new push. 

92
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:44,610
 >> The idea of getting kids to go into the 
habit of saving earlier than we currently 

93
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,453
do, and the idea of giving them some 
rules of thumb about what's appropriate 

94
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:53,36
is incredibly important. 
[NOISE] 

95
00:05:53,36 --> 00:05:56,850
 >> Ariely has his own rules. 

96
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,921
He gives his kids old fashioned 
allowances with spending constraints 

97
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:06,406
since the kids are exposed to the usual 
come ons of American culture. 

98
00:06:06,406 --> 00:06:08,370
 >> Amitush/g, what's your favorite TV show? 

99
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:13,826
 >> My favorite TV show Power Ranger Samurai. 

100
00:06:13,826 --> 00:06:16,34
 >> Ariely tries to counter the culture by 

101
00:06:16,34 --> 00:06:18,230
nurturing self control. 

102
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,962
 >> What would you rather do, watch one show 
now and then go and do all your homework, 

103
00:06:24,962 --> 00:06:34,897
or do all your homework now, and later 
get two shows of Power Rangers Samurai? 

104
00:06:34,897 --> 00:06:35,380
 >> Two shows later. 

105
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,766
 >> Okay, Amitush if that's your choice, go 

106
00:06:36,766 --> 00:06:38,280
and do your homework now. 

107
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,959
 >> Eight year old Amit, about Grover's age. 

108
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:41,774
 >> Okay, sure. 

109
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:45,708
 >> Dutifully trudges off. 
It's Neta's turn. 

110
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,486
At four, she's about Elmo's vintage. 

111
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:53,350
 >> So, what would you rather do, play for 10 
minutes now and then go and clean your 

112
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:00,341
room, or to clean your room first and 
then come and play for 20 minutes? 

113
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:02,598
 >> Play for a long time. 

114
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,446
 >> A daughter of Dan Ariely, Neta has 

115
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,82
already learned the key lesson. 

116
00:07:07,82 --> 00:07:08,530
 >> Okay, so go a clean now. 

117
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,266
 >> No. 

118
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,848
 >> Come on, go and clean, you said that's 
what you prefer. 

119
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:13,312
 >> No. 

120
00:07:13,312 --> 00:07:15,626
 >> so here we have, this is not a 

121
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,700
hypothetical. 
[LAUGH] Once you make it concrete. 

122
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,104
 >> This is generally a problem that 

123
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,910
self-control sounds like a good idea, 
even to kids, in principle. 

124
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,280
When you have to act on it, it's a bit 
more difficult. 

125
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,89
 >> Difficult, but essential, says 

126
00:07:30,89 --> 00:07:32,290
psychologist Terri Moffitt. 

127
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:36,980
 >> This generation of children is going to 
live to be, on average, far beyond 100 

128
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,610
years old. 
And that means it's absolutely essential 

129
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,550
for every child to learn how to develop 
self control skills so that they can 

130
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:52,445
avoid dependency, poor health, and 
poverty in old age. 

131
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:55,19
 >> And avoid the siren songs of the world's 

132
00:07:55,19 --> 00:07:58,32
increasingly crafty pitchmen. 

133
00:07:58,32 --> 00:08:02,192
 >> If people who are 15 now will have an 
even harder time dealing with temptation 

134
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:04,606
than you and I are. 

135
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:06,68
 >> You think? 

136
00:08:06,68 --> 00:08:09,165
 >> Yeah, I'm certain. 
Alright, because as technology develop, 

137
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:12,564
what is technology going to do? 
Technology is going to help them delay 

138
00:08:12,564 --> 00:08:16,168
gratification or have more things to 
spend their money on now. 

139
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:18,296
 >> So, are the brains of most of us now 

140
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:23,616
over-matched by the brains of[LAUGH] some 
very able people who have an incentive to 

141
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:28,166
get us to act in the here and now? 

142
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,570
 >> I, I think so. 
There's really kind of a very strong 

143
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,365
imbalance about how much we can tempt 
people, and how much people can actually 

144
00:08:34,365 --> 00:08:36,710
resist temptation. 

145
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,962
 >> And that, of course, is where Sesame 
Street comes in. 

146
00:08:39,962 --> 00:08:46,394
Elmo works various jobs to come up with 
his $5 for the stupendous ball. 

147
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:48,410
 >> Savings is not a natural concept, it's 

148
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,187
something we all have to learn. 
If I'm a preschooler, I need examples on 

149
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:57,777
how to work towards that saving. 
You model it, you show them, and you do 

150
00:08:57,777 --> 00:09:00,865
it during your everyday experiences as 
well. 

151
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:04,288
 >> In the end, Elmo earns the five bucks. 

152
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:04,904
 >> [INAUDIBLE] . 

153
00:09:04,904 --> 00:09:09,126
But then shares a dollar with his 
literally irrepressible pal. 

154
00:09:09,126 --> 00:09:09,676
 >> Oh no. 

155
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:10,470
 >> Cookie Monster. 

156
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,750
 >> Me no have cookie. 

157
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,207
 >> For more than 40 years, an icon of 

158
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,695
excess. 

159
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,899
 >> Me really want cookie. 

160
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,938
 >> Reminding us that though restraint may be 
the key to prosperity. 

161
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,920
 >> Here's $1 for a cookie. 

162
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,35
 >> Financial and otherwise, it's a daunting 

163
00:09:29,35 --> 00:09:32,857
challenge for Muppet and man alike. 

164
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:40,179
 >> Hey Elmo, that was really a nice thing 
you did. 

165
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:46,542
[NOISE] I'm PBS News Hour Economics 
correspondent Bald Solman, and you can 

166
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:53,785
call this the Colbert Report Retort. 
My response to Stephen Colbert's segment 

167
00:09:53,785 --> 00:09:57,865
poking fun at my segment about Sesame 
Street economics. 

168
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:01,532
 >> Fun for him, for me, transformative. 

169
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:02,85
[LAUGH] 

170
00:10:02,85 --> 00:10:07,378
 >> These monsters, Cookie and otherwise, are 
brainwashing our kids as part of a new 

171
00:10:07,378 --> 00:10:12,355
initiative called for me, for you, for 
later[LAUGH] which teaches tots the 

172
00:10:12,355 --> 00:10:20,615
importance of saving and self-control. 
This Muppet fiscal conservatism is based 

173
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:24,802
on a social science experiment called the 
Marshmallow Test. 

174
00:10:24,802 --> 00:10:29,420
For more, we turn to Grover and an 
unnamed Muppet made of leather. 

175
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:33,486
Sometimes people do this test with kids 
your age. 

176
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:37,380
[LAUGH] They say I'll give you a 
marshmallow now, or if you wait a little 

177
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,460
while, I'll give you two marshmallows, 
but only if you wait. 

178
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,809
 >> Two marshmallows. 

179
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,300
 >> Would it be hard to wait? 

180
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,288
 >> Would be very hard to wait, yes. 

181
00:10:47,288 --> 00:10:47,778
[LAUGH] 

182
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:51,430
 >> A Muppet made of leather. 
Colbert tossed off that line. 

183
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,840
But as you can see, I still haven't 
really gotten over it. 

184
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,365
So the theory is, that if I resist eating 
this now, then[LAUGH] I get to have two 

185
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:05,410
later. 
Let's try it. 

186
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,601
[LAUGH] Where's the marshmallow? 
[LAUGH] Oh well, let's try it the other 

187
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:12,624
way. 
Here are two that I can have later as 

188
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:15,150
long as I resist eating this one[LAUGH] 
right now. 

189
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,21
 >> Now, in our news hour story, we also 

190
00:11:18,21 --> 00:11:24,753
featured behavioral psychologist Dan 
Ariely who performed a self-control test 

191
00:11:24,753 --> 00:11:29,468
with his own daughter, Neta. 

192
00:11:29,468 --> 00:11:34,460
 >> So, what would you rather do, play for 10 
minutes now and then go and clean your 

193
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:41,590
room, or to clean your room first, and 
then come and play for 20 minutes? 

194
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,210
 >> Play for a long time. 

195
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,366
 >> A daughter of Dan Ariely, Neta has 

196
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:48,430
already learned the key lesson. 

197
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,425
 >> Okay, so go and clean now. 

198
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:54,616
 >> Come on, go and clean. 
You said that's what you prefer. 

199
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:54,685
 >> No. 

200
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:56,739
 >> so here we have, this is not a 

201
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:00,660
hypothetical once you make it concrete. 

202
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,846
 >> This is generally a problem that 
self-control sounds like a good idea, 

203
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:07,433
even to kids in principle. 
When you have to act on it, it's a bit 

204
00:12:07,433 --> 00:12:08,640
more difficult. 

205
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,590
 >> As Stephen Colbert was demonstrating on 
his report. 

206
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,10
 >> You know what? 

207
00:12:13,10 --> 00:12:17,692
I'll try it with a different food. 
Okay, here's broccoli, okay? 

208
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:22,900
Now, if I resist this stalk of broccoli 
for 10 seconds, I can have two 

209
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,896
marshmallows, alright? 
[LAUGH] Ready? 

210
00:12:27,896 --> 00:12:31,400
Go. 
I can't wait to find out what happens. 

211
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,313
[LAUGH] I bet I can do it. 
[LAUGH] Uh-huh. 

212
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:36,635
 >> Three, two, one. 

213
00:12:36,635 --> 00:12:37,629
[SOUND] 

214
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:45,678
 >> I did it. 
[NOISE] And now, and now, because I've 

215
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:55,574
been good,[LAUGH] I can have my broccoli. 

216
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,416
[SOUND][NOISE] 

217
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:07,53
In your face Elmo. 
I'm eating marshmallows. 

218
00:13:07,53 --> 00:13:08,432
[LAUGH] 

219
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:24,194
 >> We sent the video clip to Dan, Neta and 
her brother, Amit, for their reaction. 

220
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,190
 >> Hey Neta, what did you think of this? 

221
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,325
 >> what does he did to eat marshmallows 

222
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,784
before broccoli? 

223
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,820
 >> Why does he get to eat marshmallows 
before before broccoli. 

224
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,882
That bothered you? 

225
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:35,288
 >> Mm-hm. 

226
00:13:35,288 --> 00:13:37,522
 >> Yeah. 
Amitush/g, any reasons why? 

227
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,349
 >> I think maybe because he's a grown up and 

228
00:13:39,349 --> 00:13:44,590
he has his own TV show, he, he can't 
follow, he doesn't need to follow. 

229
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,960
 >> Doesn't need to follow the rules. 

230
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,320
Okay Colbert, you may have your own 
rules, your own show, care. 

231
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,645
But, if as they say you are what you eat, 
I warn you. 

232
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:58,696
There could be a transformation in your 
future, too. 

233
00:13:58,696 --> 00:13:59,312
[NOISE] 

234
00:13:59,312 --> 00:14:04,461
 >> It's the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man. 
[NOISE] 

235
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:13,165
 >> Well, there's something you don't see 

236
00:14:13,165 --> 00:14:17,645
everyday. 

237
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:24,359
[NOISE]
