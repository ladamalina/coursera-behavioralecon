1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:06,461
The second case I want us to think about
in terms of reward substitution is the

2
00:00:06,461 --> 00:00:12,816
case of a medication called Coumadin.
So, Coumadin is an anti-stroke medication.

3
00:00:12,816 --> 00:00:16,732
It's a relatively good anti-stroke
medication.

4
00:00:16,732 --> 00:00:22,756
It reduces the chances of a second stroke
for about 24% to about 4%.

5
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:26,018
Now, think about it.
If you had a stroke and this was how much

6
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:30,465
this medication could reduce your second
stroke, wouldn't you take it?

7
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:34,616
And Coumadin, by the way, has a few side
effects, particularly ones that have to do

8
00:00:34,616 --> 00:00:38,459
with eating and how you can eat leafy
vegetables and some with bleeding, but

9
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:43,460
generally has low side effects.
But, sadly, compliance is very low.

10
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,223
It's the same problem.
What's good for you now, and what's good

11
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:50,384
for you in the future.
Okay, so we have this problem, people had

12
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,396
a stroke don't want to take Coumadin or at
least behave as if they don't want to take

13
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:57,318
Coumadin.
And we can take this as an indication that

14
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:01,807
they don't care about taking another,
getting another stroke or we could take it

15
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:06,430
as an indication that something is wrong
about the incentive structure on how they

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,068
get discounted over time.
So, to get into reward substitution we

17
00:01:10,068 --> 00:01:13,148
want two things.
We want to be able to measure something,

18
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:16,044
and we want to start rewarding or
punishing it.

19
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:19,440
So, for the measurement perspective
there's a new technology out there.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,225
Maybe not so new, called Internet-enabled
pillbox.

21
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:27,270
These are pillboxes that every time you
open them it registers on the internet

22
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:30,632
somewhere and somebody can know that
you've opened the pillbox.

23
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:34,174
Now, right now, they don't yet measure if
you've taken the pill or not.

24
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:38,618
But we're going to assume that it's going
to measure both, that you opened the

25
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:42,520
pillbox and took the pill.
So, now we have this measurement approach.

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,247
The question is, how can we reward it?
And how can we punish it?

27
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:51,292
So, think to yourself for a minute, you
have this pillbox, people are on Coumadin,

28
00:01:51,292 --> 00:01:56,020
what can you do?
So, there's lots of things that we can do.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,477
The easiest thing that probably comes to
mind is paying people.

30
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:02,675
We can pay people.
Maybe we can charege them.

31
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:05,583
Maybe we can tell their kids about it or
their parents about it.

32
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:10,203
Maybe we can tell the doctor about it in
hope that their parents or their doctors

33
00:02:10,203 --> 00:02:15,992
would get them to feel guilty about it.
Maybe we could create a competition

34
00:02:15,992 --> 00:02:20,370
between people who are doing it.
Maybe you can do something more extreme.

35
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:24,594
Maybe we can create a situation that
unless you take your pill, you can't open

36
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:27,408
the refrigerator.
Or maybe we can take the pills and cover

37
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:29,930
them with chocolate, creating immediate
incentives.

38
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,754
But anyway, you could see there's a whole
range of things you could do, the moment

39
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,114
that we need to add incentives to make
that happen.

40
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:41,948
So, now I want to tell you about the few
experiments we've done on this, and of

41
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:45,812
course, the potential range of experiments
is just huge and we haven't done many of

42
00:02:45,812 --> 00:02:48,146
them.
So, these are experiments that we have

43
00:02:48,146 --> 00:02:52,294
tried out on George Lowenstein and Kevin
Volpp, and some of their colleagues have

44
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:54,776
tried it as well.
I'm going to kind of give you a

45
00:02:54,776 --> 00:02:59,908
combination of all of those experiments.
So, what do you think would happen if we

46
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:03,867
gave people $3 a day to take their
medication on time?

47
00:03:03,868 --> 00:03:07,766
Turns out, nothing much.
What do you think would happen if we gave

48
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,349
people $1,000 a day to take their
medication on time?

49
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,268
I think much like you, the prediction is
that yes, people would take their

50
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:19,050
medication on time for $1,000 a day.
The problem is we don't have $1,000 a day,

51
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,463
we only have a little bit of money.
So, the next task is to think about how we

52
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:28,971
can take a small amount of money and make
it look larger, what is called super-size

53
00:03:28,971 --> 00:03:32,302
the incentive.
How we can take the same amount and make

54
00:03:32,302 --> 00:03:35,700
it look larger.
So, one of the things we try is to use a

55
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,307
principle called loss aversion.
And loss aversion is the basic idea that

56
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:47,157
people like gaining, but we hate losing.
Gaining 3 dollars is exciting, but losing

57
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:51,366
3 dollars is really miserable and the
misery is much, much larger than the

58
00:03:51,366 --> 00:03:54,760
happiness.
And because of that, if we get people to

59
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,795
lose, it will be more effective.
So, for example, what do you think would

60
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:03,020
happen if we pre-paid people as if they
took their medication for 3 months, and

61
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,050
then, we would take money away from them
for every day they don't take their

62
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,624
medication, turns out that's more
effective.

63
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:15,419
You could come up with another idea.
You could say, what if instead of giving

64
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,980
people $3 dollars a day, we would give a
$100 dollars if the took their medication

65
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,594
for awhile.
Then, the amount is larger, but remember

66
00:04:24,594 --> 00:04:29,571
also the discount is higher and future
events need to be much, much larger to

67
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:34,046
influence us today.
So, you want to bring something to today,

68
00:04:34,046 --> 00:04:37,426
the immediate reward.
By the way, here is something I haven't

69
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:42,020
tested, but I would love to try it out.
You go to people who are taking Coumadin,

70
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,060
and every morning you wake them up by
showing them a particular kid in Africa

71
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,020
who might get fed today if they take the
medication on time.

72
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,640
It's against $3 and not only that, that
money might go to that kid, they also know

73
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,700
that kid would get to see them in the
evening and say good night to them,

74
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,500
whether they've taken the medication or
not.

75
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,964
And I've predicted under those conditions,
it would be incredibly hard for people not

76
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:10,808
to give the money, because it would go to
somebody else, to fulfill a really

77
00:05:10,808 --> 00:05:14,652
important goal and you'll have to look
into this person's eyes later in the

78
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:18,834
evening and feel incredibly guilty, if
they haven't taken their medication.

79
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:23,384
There's lots of ethical problems, as you
can see, with all of these, but we'll

80
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:26,307
continue.
Now, here's some stuff that Kevin and

81
00:05:26,307 --> 00:05:29,989
George have done which I think it
incredibly inspiring.

82
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,210
The first thing they did was they said,
you know what?

83
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,901
Money is great, but people love lotteries.
In fact, the columnists often call

84
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:44,589
lotteries a taxation on stupidity because
they expected value is usually quite very,

85
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:47,050
very low.
But nevertheless people love lotteries.

86
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,089
That's why we have Vegas.
That's why we have random reinforcements.

87
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,796
So, what do you think would happen if
instead of giving people $3 in cash for

88
00:05:56,796 --> 00:06:00,124
sure, you give them 10% chance of making
$30?

89
00:06:00,124 --> 00:06:05,614
Turns out, that's much more exciting.
In fact, the ideal way to create a lottery

90
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:10,455
is to create a lottery with two things.
You have one big reward that you could

91
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:13,519
dream about, but get very, very
infrequently.

92
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,930
But that fulfills the aspiration level.
And then, you have smaller rewards that

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,210
have a higher probability of actually
being given out.

94
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:25,053
So, from time to time, if you're in the
system you can get some reward and it

95
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:28,030
reminds you that you have a chance of
getting the big one.

96
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,050
If you only had the big one, then most
days you don't get anything.

97
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,308
It's not that exciting.
So, you want a combination of a really big

98
00:06:34,308 --> 00:06:38,613
reward and some small rewards that keep
people in the game and feel excited.

99
00:06:38,613 --> 00:06:42,078
So, lotteries are good, but they didn't
stop there.

100
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:45,081
They added another component called
regret.

101
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:50,463
And regret is a really interesting idea
and it's worthwhile stopping and thinking

102
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:53,089
about it for a while.
So, what is regret?

103
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:57,786
Regret is about the fact that our
happiness with where we are in life is not

104
00:06:57,786 --> 00:07:02,791
about where we are, it's a comparison
between where we are and where we think we

105
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,944
could have been.
And if this other place where we think we

106
00:07:05,944 --> 00:07:09,150
could have been is better than where we
are, we feel terrible.

107
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,630
And if this other place where we think we
could have been is worse than where we

108
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,890
are, we feel good about it.
So, here's an example.

109
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,089
When do you think you would be more
unhappy?

110
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:23,237
If you missed your flight by 2 minutes or
by 2 hours?

111
00:07:23,237 --> 00:07:25,780
Of course, by two minutes.
But why?

112
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:30,610
You're stuck at O'Hare with the same bad
airport food, with the same unpleasant

113
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,410
airport.
Why you're more unhappy if you missed your

114
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,818
flight by 2 minutes?
Because you can imagine the many ways you

115
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:40,180
would have made it.
You could say to yourself, if the TSA

116
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,348
agent had one more IQ point, everything
would have gone well, this is the security

117
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:47,834
people.
You could say to yourself, if the person

118
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:51,952
in front of me understood what taking your
shoes off mean, everything would have been

119
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:54,476
fine.
There are many, many ways in which you can

120
00:07:54,476 --> 00:07:58,572
imagine how you would have been in this
other reality, and then, the contrast

121
00:07:58,572 --> 00:08:01,399
between these two realities is incredibly
salient.

122
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,260
If you missed your by 2 hours, there's no
way for you to imagine that reality.

123
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:13,016
So, it's not creating the same contrast.
By the way, it's a personal observation.

124
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:17,566
I should tell you that I think that one of
the reasons that I think I'm generally

125
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:21,976
happy in life is that because after
sustaining a very serious injury, I have

126
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:26,526
lots of reminders about that injury and
the contrast between where I am now and

127
00:08:26,526 --> 00:08:30,490
where I was for many years in hospital, is
incredibly clear to me.

128
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,176
I think that if I had an injury that I had
the same misery for a long time, but then,

129
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:38,819
it went away, I don't think I would have
had the same benefit.

130
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:44,327
So, while these scars and some of the pain
that they give me everyday is have some

131
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:49,820
unpleasantness, I think it is useful as a
reminder of how things could have been.

132
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,430
It makes it harder for me to forget this
contrast between where I am now and where

133
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,597
I was, and therefore, I think I am happier
because of that.

134
00:08:59,598 --> 00:09:03,120
This is not a good experiment, of course
just my intuition.

135
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,711
In a very different domain, in some of the
Olympics, they took pictures of people who

136
00:09:09,711 --> 00:09:12,478
won medals.
And they asked the question of what

137
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:17,218
determines the size of the smile.
And you would think that the gold, people

138
00:09:17,218 --> 00:09:21,730
with gold would smile the most, silver
less, and bronze less.

139
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,736
But when you actually look at it, it's
gold, bronze, silver.

140
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:30,182
The people with silver are the one who are
smiling the least.

141
00:09:30,182 --> 00:09:34,008
How could that be?
Well, put yourself in the mindset of

142
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:38,120
somebody who just won the silver medal.
What are they thinking?

143
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,580
What's going through their mind?
They probably say to themselves, I was

144
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,285
this close.
In fact, it's probably not something that

145
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:48,558
is this close like in the Olympics, like
it could be milliseconds.

146
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:51,037
And what is the person with bronze
thinking?

147
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,840
They say, well at least I'm here on this
stage.

148
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,810
Look at all the other people that didn't
get here at all.

149
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,400
So, now you can see how in this case, but
also probably in areas of your own life,

150
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:05,990
happiness is not determined by where we
are, but what reality we are comparing

151
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,489
ourselves to.
And if this reality is better, we feel

152
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,439
miserable.
If this reality is worse, we feel good

153
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,570
about it.
So, let's take regret and roll it back for

154
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,334
experiment with Coumadin.
Imagine that we have a big gorup of people

155
00:10:20,334 --> 00:10:23,130
taking Coumadin.
And imagine part of these people are

156
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,083
taking the medication on time and another
part of these people are not taking the

157
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:30,206
medication on time.
If we just do the, the rewards by

158
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:35,174
lotteries to the people who've taken the
medication on time, we take all the people

159
00:10:35,174 --> 00:10:39,998
who took the medication on time, we sample
10% of them and we give them the lottery

160
00:10:39,998 --> 00:10:42,778
ticket.
We call them up, we say congratulations

161
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,347
and we give them the lottery tickets.
Now, there's no regret.

162
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:49,646
The people who are winning feel good and
the people who are not taking their

163
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:52,974
medication, don't really know that
anything bad has happened.

164
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:58,798
How do we add regret to the equation?
We're doing it by giving a lottery ticket

165
00:10:58,798 --> 00:11:02,570
for everybody in the sample.
We give it to the people who've taken

166
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:05,681
their medication on time and we giving it
to the people who did not take the

167
00:11:05,681 --> 00:11:08,430
medication on time.
And if it's somebody who did not take

168
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,584
their medication on time that comes up in
the lottery, we call them up, and we say,

169
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:16,390
congratulations, it is your lucky day.
The stars are smiling on you.

170
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,984
You're the winner of the coveted lottery.
Sadly, you did not take your pill on time,

171
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:26,407
so you're not getting the prize, you're
not getting the reward.

172
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:29,364
Now, think about it, this is the essence
of regret.

173
00:11:29,364 --> 00:11:34,062
Now, you can say to yourself, my goodness,
there was a tiny little act in the morning

174
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:38,550
of taking the medication that if I would
have engaged on that, I would been on the

175
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,760
other side of that fence.
And I really don't want to be on that

176
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,257
other side of the fence again.
And now what happens?

177
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:51,318
You combine lotteries and you combine
regret and compliance rate goes up to

178
00:11:51,318 --> 00:11:55,123
about 97%-98%.
Now, here's the thing, when you look at

179
00:11:55,123 --> 00:12:00,337
something like Coumadin, you say many
people just don't take their medication

180
00:12:00,337 --> 00:12:03,910
regularly on time, and it's terrible.
It's a blood thinner.

181
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:06,005
You should take your medication on time if
you're on Coumadin.

182
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:13,220
Luckily, we can add reward substitution.
We can add $3, potentially could add

183
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,052
shame.
We could add all kinds of other things and

184
00:12:16,052 --> 00:12:19,737
not only that, we can think about how to
maximize that incentive.

185
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:23,879
We can take, for example, $3 and think
about how we super-size it.

186
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,575
How do we add lotteries to it, randomness?
How do we add counterfactual thinking and

187
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:35,189
regret and by doing so, get people to
behave as if they care.

188
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:40,545
About getting another stroke, eventually
getting people to behave in a way that is

189
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:45,570
better for them, better for the families
and of course better for the health care

190
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,113
system.
