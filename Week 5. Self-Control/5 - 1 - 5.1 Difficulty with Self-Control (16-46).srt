1
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:05,810
In this section we're going to talk about 
self control. 

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,774
There's an older gentleman whose about to 
undergo surgery, and as it happened his 

3
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:16,500
son is the physician whose about to go 
and perform the surgery. 

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,110
And just before he goes under he says to 
his son. 

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,701
Remember son, if I don't make it out of 
this surgery, your mother is moving in 

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:29,10
with you[SOUND]. 
What is self control? 

7
00:00:29,10 --> 00:00:32,760
Self control is all about the problem 
between now and later. 

8
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:36,410
There are many problems of this nature 
and they're all around us. 

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,502
In the world and in this section we'er 
going to learn both about what causes 

10
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:44,760
these problems and also about how to 
fight them. 

11
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,99
And if you start to understand what role 
self control, both the self control 

12
00:00:48,99 --> 00:00:51,438
problems and solution whave to play with 
our lives, all of a sudden you would 

13
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:58,216
realize how much better you could get. 
And what kind of things you could do to 

14
00:00:58,216 --> 00:01:03,430
overcome some of the challenges in our 
environment. 

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,930
[MUSIC][MUSIC] 

16
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:23,180
So today, I want us to talk a little bit 
about self-control, what is the problem 

17
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:39,380
of self-control and what can we do about 
it. 

18
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,944
So to get us thinking about self control 
I want to tell you a personal story about 

19
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:46,380
one of my biggest struggles with self 
control. 

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,280
So when I was in hosptial I got some 
blood transfusion. 

21
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,997
And one of those blood transfusion had 
liver disease within in and I got this 

22
00:01:53,997 --> 00:01:57,758
liver disease. 
And as you can imagine it was bad enough 

23
00:01:57,758 --> 00:02:00,266
to be a burn patient, getting a liver 
disease on top of that was not eh, 

24
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,310
something to look forward to. 
And at that point in time they didn't 

25
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,742
know really what was the liver disease, 
they just saw my liver function eh, shot 

26
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,966
up eh, and they had to slow down 
treatment, rejected some transplants, all 

27
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:17,200
kinds of bad things had happened. 
But they couldn't identify what it was 

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,196
and there was no treatment. 
A long, long time after that, so I was in 

29
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:24,710
grad school already, I had another flare 
up of my liver. 

30
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,520
I checked myself into hospital and they 
told me that I had Hepatitis C. 

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,520
By that time, they could identify the 
particular virus I had, so this was 

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,276
Hepatitis C. 
And there's also a trial done by the FA 

33
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:40,698
or under the FDA rules to see whether a 
medication called Interferon was going to 

34
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:46,68
be effective for hepatitis c. 
Interferon was a medication that was 

35
00:02:46,68 --> 00:02:49,664
originally approved for[UNKNOWN] 
leukemia, a really awful disease that 

36
00:02:49,664 --> 00:02:54,130
nothing works for, but they approved 
Interferon for that. 

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:58,220
And now the question was would interferon 
also work for hepatitis C? 

38
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,660
And I asked him what happens if I don't 
take the medication? 

39
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,8
What happen if I don't go on the trial, 
and they described to me what it might 

40
00:03:05,8 --> 00:03:09,660
look like to die from liver cirrhosis, 
which is an awful way to go. 

41
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,321
So I opted for this trial. 
The problem was that this trial involved 

42
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:19,740
three times a week a very unpleasant 
medication. 

43
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,68
Now think to yourself, imagine that you 
had a medication in your hand, and you 

44
00:03:23,68 --> 00:03:27,160
asked yourself whether you want to inject 
yourself. 

45
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,644
And theoretically if you inject yourself 
three times a week for a year and a half, 

46
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:34,350
you might not get liver cirrhosis in 30 
years from now. 

47
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,310
But for sure you would spend the next 14 
hours with side effects. 

48
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,750
Headache, vomiting, shaking, stuff like 
that. 

49
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,130
Not as bad as liver cirrhosis, but 
certainly bad in now. 

50
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,554
Ask yourself whether you would be able to 
give yourself This, this medication. 

51
00:03:50,554 --> 00:03:54,608
Now, for me, this was a real decision 
that I faced many, many times. 

52
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:59,284
But, for you, it's hypothetical. 
So let's think about less hypothetical 

53
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:02,862
decisions. 
Let's think about things like, how many 

54
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:06,766
of you, for example, and try to be 
honest, have eaten in the last week, more 

55
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:12,600
than you think you should? 
Raise your hand. 

56
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,504
I mean even though you're just watching 
this, raise your hand and tell yourself 

57
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:20,66
whether you've done that. 
What about under exercising? 

58
00:04:20,66 --> 00:04:25,312
How many of you have exercised not as 
much as you hoped you would in the last 

59
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:31,340
month? 
How many of you procrasitinated? 

60
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:37,846
With class material, for example. 
How many you have, have you have em, 

61
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:43,112
texted while driving? 
Eh, another example that you can think 

62
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:49,186
about is how many you, of you have ever 
eh, had unplanned, unprotected sex? 

63
00:04:49,186 --> 00:04:52,446
Right? 
Now, the interesting things with all of 

64
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:56,576
these examples is that not only do we 
recognize that we have done many of 

65
00:04:56,576 --> 00:05:02,403
thems, but we also recognize that we'll 
keep on doing them. 

66
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:06,323
Procrastination, for example, many people 
start the semester or start the new year 

67
00:05:06,323 --> 00:05:10,80
by saying, this time everything will be 
great. 

68
00:05:10,80 --> 00:05:13,920
We take clean notebooks and we say we're 
going to do all the reading and all the 

69
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,940
homework but then other things come and 
eventually we fall, we fall off the path, 

70
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,720
and then again next year it's a new time 
and we don't learn from the past and we 

71
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,652
hope that we will do better this time. 
So me, by the way, one of my current 

72
00:05:28,652 --> 00:05:33,760
struggles is with sleep. 
I work until usually very late at night. 

73
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,210
And then I ask myself what do I need to 
do. 

74
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,864
Should I think about the current, my 
current needs, the things I really need 

75
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:44,0
to do right now, or the fact that I need 
to go to sleep? 

76
00:05:44,0 --> 00:05:47,498
And I delay my sleep, and delay my sleep, 
and delay my sleep until eventually I, I 

77
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:50,784
don't get a good night sleep, if you see 
black shadows under my eyes you know 

78
00:05:50,784 --> 00:05:56,582
where it Where it's coming from. 
So self control is a genearl problem when 

79
00:05:56,582 --> 00:06:00,870
it's about what's exactly now and what's 
in the future. 

80
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,830
And the future does not have to be very 
far from now. 

81
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,330
It could be quite close like tomorrow 
morning, but the current future is 

82
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:11,942
incredibly powerful. 
And we call these sometimes the present 

83
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:15,919
focus bias, that we focus on what is the. 
Present. 

84
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,430
And this, by the way is the Adam and Eve 
problem. 

85
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,455
You can ask yourself how many of us would 
sacrifice eternity of, in Garden of Eden 

86
00:06:24,455 --> 00:06:28,510
for an apple? 
Well it turns out we do it, we do it all 

87
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,518
the time. 
Now to take all of these examples, and 

88
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:35,404
think about them together as a general 
class of problems between what's good now 

89
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:41,558
and what's good in the future, I want you 
to ask yourself the following question. 

90
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:46,430
Imagine I gave you a choice, and I said, 
what would you rather have? 

91
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:51,620
A half a box of chocolate right now or a 
full box of chocolate in a week? 

92
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,644
And imagine the chocolate was just in 
front of you, and you asked, what would 

93
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:58,489
you rather have? 
Half a box now or a full in the week? 

94
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,294
I suspecting that most of you would say 
give me the half of box of chocolate 

95
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:05,246
right now. 
It's not worthwhile for me to wait 

96
00:07:05,246 --> 00:07:08,800
another week for another half a box of 
chocolate. 

97
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,180
But imagine I pushed the choices to the 
future. 

98
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,428
And I said what would you rather have a 
half a box in a year or a full box in a 

99
00:07:15,428 --> 00:07:20,426
year and a week. 
Now, of course, you realize it's the same 

100
00:07:20,426 --> 00:07:22,620
decision. 
It's the decision of whether you're 

101
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,199
willing to wait another week for another 
half a box of chocolate. 

102
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,853
Not only that, but you recognize that in 
a year from now, the second decision 

103
00:07:29,853 --> 00:07:33,565
would look just like the first one, where 
you could say, I could have the half a 

104
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:38,455
box of chocolate now, or I could wait 
another week. 

105
00:07:38,455 --> 00:07:41,911
But phrase this way and looking at it far 
in advance, as if it's a year from now, 

106
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:45,313
I'm willing to bet that all of you are 
willing to wait a year for the,a year and 

107
00:07:45,313 --> 00:07:50,993
a week for the full box of chocolate. 
You're willing to wait now another week 

108
00:07:50,993 --> 00:07:53,800
for another half a box of chocolate. 
Why is that? 

109
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,380
It's because in the future, we are 
wonderful people. 

110
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:00,955
We will exercise, we will diet, we will 
not procrastinate, we will not text and 

111
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:05,160
drive, all of those things would be 
fantastic in the future. 

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,970
The problem, of course, is that we never 
get to live in the future. 

113
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:13,660
We get to live in the present, and in the 
present we make mistakes. 

114
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,935
So now that we understand the problem of 
self control. 

115
00:08:16,935 --> 00:08:21,280
I want to go back to my story with 
interferon and hepatitis C. 

116
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,460
I want to tell you what, what I did in 
this particular case. 

117
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,390
As I took the medication for a year and a 
half. 

118
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:31,147
An a year and a half later I had another 
biopsy. 

119
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:35,691
My doctor, Dr Kilberg told me that I 
cleared, the disease which was fantastic 

120
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:39,226
news. 
A little while later the FDA approved the 

121
00:08:39,226 --> 00:08:43,230
interferon for hepatitis C, which was 
also good news. 

122
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,702
And finally he told me that I was the 
only patient in this protocol that took 

123
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:50,471
their medication regularly. 
Now you might ask yourself how could I 

124
00:08:50,471 --> 00:08:52,948
take it? 
How could I be the only patient in this 

125
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:56,820
very large protocol who took their 
medication regularly? 

126
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,520
Is it because I care more about my 
future? 

127
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,812
I care more about my liver? 
I've less problems with immediate 

128
00:09:02,812 --> 00:09:05,590
temptation. 
The answer is no to all of those. 

129
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,620
The answer is that I invented a little 
trick for myself. 

130
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,660
And my trick was based on the idea that I 
love movies. 

131
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:16,16
If I had time, I would watch lots and 
lots of movies. 

132
00:09:16,16 --> 00:09:19,180
Sadly, I don't much time so I don't watch 
that many movies. 

133
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,340
But on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 
which were injection days for me, on the 

134
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,520
way to school I would first stop in a 
video store. 

135
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,922
I would rent some videos I really wanted 
to watch, and I would carry them in my 

136
00:09:30,922 --> 00:09:35,328
backpack the whole day. 
I would get home in the evening, I would 

137
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:39,675
look at the videos, I would put one in, I 
would inject myself and I would press 

138
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:43,500
play. 
I did not wait for the side effects to 

139
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,75
start, instead what I did is I connected 
the movies that I wanted to see with the 

140
00:09:47,75 --> 00:09:50,450
injection. 
Which was something that I didn't want to 

141
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,665
see. 
I would press play, I would take a bucket 

142
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:56,660
and a blanket for the side effect. 
And I would start a night of watching 

143
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,295
movies. 
And then of course the side effect would 

144
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:02,600
start and the evening did not end up 
being so good. 

145
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,22
Now if you think about it, there's a 
couple of strange things about this 

146
00:10:06,22 --> 00:10:09,866
story. 
The first thing is that if we made a list 

147
00:10:09,866 --> 00:10:13,620
of what's important in life livers would 
be up there. 

148
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,564
Really really important we have only one. 
Side effects and injections much much 

149
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:21,794
less important. 
And if you thought about it in this way, 

150
00:10:21,794 --> 00:10:25,174
you should think that me and all the 
other patients should have the medication 

151
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:28,980
all the time. 
But of course this is not how we think 

152
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,820
about it, the effect of the liver is 
dramatically discounted because we also 

153
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,76
have the time component. 
The liver is not, we're not going to get 

154
00:10:37,76 --> 00:10:40,440
sick now. 
It might happen in 30 years from now. 

155
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,920
And because of this the effect of the 
liver is largely discounted and the 

156
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,253
effect of the injection looks much much 
larger because it is in the present. 

157
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,146
That's the first part. 
The second part is that if you think 

158
00:10:53,146 --> 00:10:57,260
about my solution, the movie solution, 
it's kind of a strange idea. 

159
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,22
That solution did not involve anything 
with the word livers, or did not involve 

160
00:11:01,22 --> 00:11:04,320
anything about caring more about the 
liver. 

161
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,620
It had a little equation that says movies 
for injection, or injection for movies. 

162
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,812
And we call this reward substitution. 
And the idea with reward substitution is 

163
00:11:14,812 --> 00:11:18,470
that there are some things in life that 
are too much in the future, and we're 

164
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:23,110
very unlikely to care about them for the 
right reasons. 

165
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,299
But we don't have to give up. 
Instead, what we could do is we could say 

166
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:31,386
let us take other things, other rewards 
that are going to be present in our 

167
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:36,691
immediate environment. 
And by acting towards these rewards, we 

168
00:11:36,691 --> 00:11:41,580
can behave as if we care about our liver. 
So think about it: What are things in 

169
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:45,210
life, in which we're just not designed to 
care about the final goal for the right 

170
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:49,343
reason? 
And are there shortcuts, are there ways 

171
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:53,887
to care about something else that would 
get us to behave as if we care about the 

172
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:59,158
final goal. 
So, let me let us think together about a 

173
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:04,60
couple of examples like this. 
The first example I want you to think 

174
00:12:04,60 --> 00:12:07,657
about is global warming. 
Global warming is very far in the future 

175
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:10,695
and you can ask yourself whether people 
can wake up in the morning, and feel 

176
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:15,914
energized to care about global warming. 
Now, I don't know what you personally 

177
00:12:15,914 --> 00:12:19,450
think about global warming. 
Let's not worry about it for now. 

178
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,155
Let's just assume that global warming is 
a real problem, and let's think about 

179
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:27,56
whether under those conditions people can 
either care. 

180
00:12:27,56 --> 00:12:31,550
The answer is probably not. 
It's probably going to be incredibly 

181
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,600
tough. 
In fact, if you took this problem and 

182
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,454
looked at it from the other way. 
And you said, let's create the problem 

183
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:41,599
that would maximize human apathy. 
You would probably come up with global 

184
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,160
warming. 
Why? 

185
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,308
Because global warming is far in the 
future, would happen to other people 

186
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,480
first. 
We don't see it progressing. 

187
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,230
We don't see any particular person 
suffering. 

188
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,180
And anything we would do as individual is 
a drop in the bucket. 

189
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,978
Under those five forces of empathy, can 
we care? 

190
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,540
Very, very unlikely. 
It's almost like a perfect storm of 

191
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,640
apathy. 
So, what can we do? 

192
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,215
If people are not going to care for the 
right reason, can we create other things 

193
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:13,809
that would get people to behave as if 
they care? 

194
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,542
So now the challenge for us to think 
about all the things that could motivate 

195
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:23,638
human beings, and which one of them we 
could tie in a rewared substitution way 

196
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:28,876
to global warming. 
So you could say what if we pay people, 

197
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,647
right? 
We can either pay people or tax them to 

198
00:13:31,647 --> 00:13:34,156
behave well. 
That's one approach. 

199
00:13:34,156 --> 00:13:38,384
Another approach could be let's make it 
more easy, more convenient. 

200
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,884
That's another way. 
You can also think about something like 

201
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:45,450
reputation or prestige, or making 
something look cool. 

202
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:51,56
You can think about giving people points. 
or making them feel that they are making 

203
00:13:51,56 --> 00:13:56,134
some progress something. 
gamers by the way Really understand 

204
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:59,600
reward substitions. 
Gamers want you to work for them for a 

205
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,940
long time playing their games with no 
money whatsoever. 

206
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,901
So they had to think about all kinds of 
ways to get people to motivate without 

207
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:09,150
paying them. 
And they come up with lots of ways. 

208
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,400
For example, having a leaderboard that 
tells you how you are compared to other 

209
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,660
people. 
Here is one example to think about in 

210
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,622
this case. 
In the US, when the Toyota Prius came, 

211
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:24,80
which is a hybrid car, there was another 
car by Honda that was also a hybrid. 

212
00:14:24,80 --> 00:14:28,80
And the Toyota Prius did very well and 
the Honda didn't do that well. 

213
00:14:28,80 --> 00:14:31,69
And there could be all kinds of reasons, 
but I think that one of them was the 

214
00:14:31,69 --> 00:14:34,545
Toyota Prius looked so different from the 
other cars. 

215
00:14:34,545 --> 00:14:37,928
Now think about it. 
If you're driving your Toyota Prius, you 

216
00:14:37,928 --> 00:14:41,80
could tell yourself look at me, I'm a 
wonderful, kind human being. 

217
00:14:41,80 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm driving a hybrid car. 
If you're driving the Honda, you could do 

218
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,342
the same thing. 
But if you're driving the Prius, you can 

219
00:14:47,342 --> 00:14:50,852
also tell yourself that other people, the 
people around you, are noticing how 

220
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:55,920
different your car look like. 
They realize what a wonderful kind human 

221
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,495
being you are, and you get to bask in the 
reflected glory of the people who drive 

222
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:03,342
around you. 
Could it be that the fact that the other 

223
00:15:03,342 --> 00:15:06,590
Prius created an external signal to 
communicate to other people what 

224
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,522
wonderful people we are, the Prius 
driving people. 

225
00:15:10,522 --> 00:15:15,750
Created an extra benefit for those 
people, and therefore got them to behave. 

226
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,660
Now, this is not a great scientific 
study. 

227
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,540
It's actually not even a good scientific 
study. 

228
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,100
But I went to my friends. 
And I have some Toyota Prius driving 

229
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,234
friends. 
And some non Toyota Prius driving 

230
00:15:25,234 --> 00:15:27,627
friends. 
And I asked them all, what else have they 

231
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:31,240
done for energy conservation? 
Changing light bulbs. 

232
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,610
High efficiency appliances. 
Change the insulation in the attic. 

233
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,640
Changing what, what therm, temperature 
they keep the house in. 

234
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,618
And you know what? 
These two group of my friends, maybe it's 

235
00:15:41,618 --> 00:15:46,444
just about my friends, are no different. 
They are different on a Toyota Prius. 

236
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:50,14
They are no different on anything else. 
Now, you can make fun of course of the 

237
00:15:50,14 --> 00:15:53,891
people who drive Toyota Prius. 
But I think the real issue is that Toyota 

238
00:15:53,891 --> 00:15:58,246
Prius gave people another benefit, and 
that benefit made people be willing to 

239
00:15:58,246 --> 00:16:04,30
invest money in that particular approach 
of energy conservation. 

240
00:16:04,30 --> 00:16:07,874
What would happen if we had the same 
ability to convey to other people who we 

241
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:11,594
are, for example, but getting people to 
know what temperature we set our 

242
00:16:11,594 --> 00:16:17,10
thermostat to or how much insulation we 
have in our attic. 

243
00:16:17,10 --> 00:16:20,290
Imagine that your Facebook profile 
included those elements. 

244
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,881
Could you all of a sudden care in a 
public signaling way about those elements 

245
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:27,950
as well? 
I think there is a potential. 

246
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:33,800
So this was the first example, of how we 
can think about reward substitution in 

247
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,575
the domain of caring about the world. 

248
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:46,828
[SOUND]
