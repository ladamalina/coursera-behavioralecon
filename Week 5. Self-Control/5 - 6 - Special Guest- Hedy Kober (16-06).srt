1
00:00:00,3 --> 00:00:04,972
Hi my name is Hedy Kober. 
And I'm psychologist and a cognitive 

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:11,130
therapist scientist at Yale University. 
And if you remember one thing from my 

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,580
talk today, let it be this. 
If you want to you can train yourself to 

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,940
have better self-control. 
But before we start going to take a step 

5
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,772
back and try to define, what is 
self-control? 

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,322
I like to think about it in a few 
different ways. 

7
00:00:24,322 --> 00:00:28,255
Self control, or self regulation, I am 
going to use these terms interchangeably, 

8
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:31,561
is what you exercise when you want to 
change something about how you'd 

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:36,322
otherwise think, feel or behave in any 
given situation. 

10
00:00:36,322 --> 00:00:39,377
And you can think about situations when 
you need to use self control as those in 

11
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:43,704
which you have options for your emotions, 
your thoughts or your behaviors. 

12
00:00:43,704 --> 00:00:47,590
And you need to exert some effort in 
choosing one over the other. 

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,194
You might ask yourself why would I need 
to exert some effort? 

14
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,670
Well, typically is because one option is 
harder to choose. 

15
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,120
And that's typically the one that's 
better for you in the long term. 

16
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,78
Now, you may have heard self-control 
defined as a set of problems that 

17
00:00:58,78 --> 00:01:01,360
differentiate between what's now and 
what's later. 

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,490
And so the idea is that one of the 
options comes naturally in this moment. 

19
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:08,848
like when you're tempted by cake, and you 
really want to eat it and it looks really 

20
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:11,402
good. 
But the other option is to control 

21
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:16,250
yourself, and you need to exert some 
effort not to be tempted by this cake. 

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,980
Now, self-control can be exercised in 
different domains, as I've already 

23
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,278
alluded to. 
There's control of thought, for example 

24
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:24,80
when you have a persistent thought. 
Maybe about something that upset you, 

25
00:01:24,80 --> 00:01:26,800
something that didn't go quite as well as 
you had hoped. 

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,300
Maybe someone broke your heart. 
the control of emotions. 

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,550
Sometimes you have negative emotion. 
You're angry at someone, you're upset 

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,676
about something. 
And there are ways that you can reduce 

29
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:37,767
that kind of negative emotion. 
Of course, there's also control of 

30
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:40,380
craving or temptation. 
Which is kind of the canonical way that 

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,453
we think about self control. 
And one of the ways that I'm going to 

32
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,910
talk about it today. 
And then there's the control of behavior, 

33
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,200
which is really linked to, to, to these 
other forms of control. 

34
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,116
and this includes how to stay focused on 
a task. 

35
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:54,600
But it also includes choosing to behave 
in a particular way that's better for 

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,252
you. 
Or stopping yourself from behaving in 

37
00:01:57,252 --> 00:02:02,374
ways that are slightly less optimal. 
And the amazing thing is that we have to 

38
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:07,310
exercise self control all the time in 
many, many different kinds of contexts. 

39
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,348
For example, you are exercising self 
control right now because you're not 

40
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:13,390
taking a nap and you're probably not 
eating cake. 

41
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,351
You're watching me talk about self 
control and that probably requires some 

42
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:20,404
self control on your part. 
and to illustrate that, I want you to 

43
00:02:20,404 --> 00:02:24,824
find more examples of when you exercise 
self control successfully in the last 

44
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:28,386
month. 
So you probably though of a few times 

45
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:31,714
When you've exercised self control 
successfully and you can give yourself a 

46
00:02:31,714 --> 00:02:36,672
point for each one of these instances. 
for example, maybe you criticized someone 

47
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,256
in your head. 
But you didn't tell them about it because 

48
00:02:39,256 --> 00:02:41,739
you thought it was going to hurt their 
feelings. 

49
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,267
Maybe you were really tired, even 
exhausted, but you still brush your teeth 

50
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:48,219
before bedtime. 
how about you got irritated walking down 

51
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:51,100
the street, someone bumped into you. 
Maybe you were in traffic. 

52
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,8
But you didn't yell at anybody, you 
didn't act on it in any kind of way. 

53
00:02:54,8 --> 00:02:58,162
and all of these are examples of 
successful self-control, and good for 

54
00:02:58,162 --> 00:03:01,389
you. 
Of course, the other side of that is also 

55
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,304
really important. 
We, not infrequently fail at 

56
00:03:04,304 --> 00:03:07,517
self-control, and the classic way to 
think about this are times when you've 

57
00:03:07,517 --> 00:03:09,811
done that recently. 
Right? 

58
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:12,761
So maybe you texted while you were 
driving or you were tempted to eat 

59
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:15,712
dessert even when you thought you 
shouldn't. 

60
00:03:15,712 --> 00:03:18,862
And what you can see from both kinds of 
these examples is that self control is 

61
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:23,251
part of almost everything that you do. 
And that you do this with varying levels 

62
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:26,820
of success. 
But there's something that is central and 

63
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,390
really important to many, many aspects of 
your life. 

64
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,82
And indeed, research has shown repeatedly 
that being able to exercise self-control 

65
00:03:34,82 --> 00:03:38,34
effectively is associated with long-term 
health, long-term happiness and long-term 

66
00:03:38,34 --> 00:03:41,290
success. 
And it doesn't mean that exercising 

67
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,685
self-control in a particular moment would 
make you happy. 

68
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:48,554
But people who exercise self-control in 
general.tend to behave more consistently 

69
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:51,681
with their long term goals and are 
typically happier and healthier as a 

70
00:03:51,681 --> 00:03:54,940
result. 
In the first set of experiments that 

71
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,940
really showed that nicely was Walter 
Mischel's Marshmallow Test Experiments. 

72
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,760
And in these experiments, kids are put in 
a room in front of a table where a 

73
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,120
marshmallow or a cookie are presented and 
they're given a choice. 

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,960
You can either eat the marshmallow now. 
Or you can wait 15 minutes and get two 

75
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,338
marshmallows. 
And for kids, marshmallows are really 

76
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,320
exciting. 
They love marshmallows. 

77
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,90
If you've ever met kids, you know that's 
true. 

78
00:04:17,90 --> 00:04:19,950
And so, for them, the temptation to eat 
the marshmallow or the cookie right now 

79
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,6
is really high. 
And the question is, of course, can they 

80
00:04:23,6 --> 00:04:26,550
regulate their craving? 
Can they control their behavior and delay 

81
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,522
their gratification? 
And before I tell you what the answer is, 

82
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:32,730
I want you to think back, for when you 
were a kid. 

83
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,354
Three, or four, or five, just like the 
kids in these experiments, do you think 

84
00:04:35,354 --> 00:04:38,679
you'd be able to wait for a second 
marshmallow or a second cookie? 

85
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:41,862
Well, I wanted to know what the answer 
was for me and I thought about it and I 

86
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:44,410
wasn't exactly sure. 
And so, I called my mother. 

87
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,356
And my mother said this. 
She said, you were so stubborn as a 

88
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:50,223
child, that maybe to prove a point you 
might have waited, but you also had a 

89
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:53,730
really, really hard time delaying 
gratification. 

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:56,208
And then, she thought about it another 
moment and she said, and if it was 

91
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,686
pretzels, there was no way that you would 
have waited because they were your 

92
00:04:58,686 --> 00:05:03,220
favorite. 
And, of course, I'm just one example. 

93
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,404
But the idea is that there's variability. 
And the results in these experiments were 

94
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:10,390
exactly that. 
Kids varied in their ability to wait. 

95
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,330
Some kids couldn't wait at all. 
As soon as the experimenter left the 

96
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,840
room, [SOUND] immediately they ate the 
cookie or they ate the marshmallow. 

97
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,324
Other kids managed to wait the entire 15 
minutes, and at the end of the experiment 

98
00:05:20,324 --> 00:05:24,886
they got two cookies or two marshmallows. 
But the second and really, really 

99
00:05:24,886 --> 00:05:28,241
important finding is that the number of 
minutes that kids waited ended up 

100
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:32,160
predicting a whole host of outcomes for 
their lives. 

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,870
They were better l-, better rated by 
their teachers in school just a few years 

102
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,945
later. 
They got better SAT scores in high 

103
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:41,742
school. 
They made more money, they, didn't go to 

104
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,920
jail and didn't use as many drugs when 
they were in their 20s and 30s. 

105
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,500
So many many long time successes were 
associated with better self control. 

106
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,853
And I'll get back to these experiments in 
just a few minutes to make another point. 

107
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,389
But what we can learn from this now is 
that the ability to exercise self control 

108
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,220
is incredibly important. 
Has great implications for life. 

109
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,315
And in fact, a recent set of experiments 
has shown that self control is a better 

110
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:09,990
predictor of school performance in kids 
than even IQ. 

111
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,162
And as a researcher, as soon as I 
realized how important self control was, 

112
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:17,730
I knew that we needed to find out more 
about how it works. 

113
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,691
And I started reading a lot about it and 
one of the metaphors that I came to 

114
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:24,660
really like was the metaphor of self 
control as a mental muscle. 

115
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,479
And I really like it because self control 
ends up being like a mental muscle in 

116
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,786
three important ways. 
The first way is that if in any given 

117
00:06:32,786 --> 00:06:36,881
moment, if you exercise the right 
technique or the right strategy, you can 

118
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:42,330
lift much heavier weights. 
You can do a lot more with this muscle. 

119
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:46,260
The second way is that this muscle 
doesn't have, infinite capacity. 

120
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:49,64
It's somewhat limited. 
if you use the muscle a lot earlier in 

121
00:06:49,64 --> 00:06:52,88
the day, you might have less ability to 
use it later in the day, just like with 

122
00:06:52,88 --> 00:06:56,380
real muscles. 
And the third thing is really cool, I 

123
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,45
think. 
Potentially, the most amazing, which is, 

124
00:06:59,45 --> 00:07:02,105
you can teach yourself or train yourself 
to have much stronger mental muscle self 

125
00:07:02,105 --> 00:07:05,12
control. 
That will allow you to do much more over 

126
00:07:05,12 --> 00:07:07,259
time. 
Okay, let's break it down. 

127
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,166
So the first was technique, right. 
And the idea that if you learn the right 

128
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:16,270
technique and exercise it in the moment 
you can exhibit much better self control. 

129
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,390
There are already strategies you can set 
up ahead of time to ensure that you'll 

130
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:24,140
have better self control and one such 
strategy is to use reward substitution. 

131
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,480
Maybe there's something that you don't 
want to do. 

132
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,720
You can promise yourself a reward. 
instead of the task itself. 

133
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Or in my case, for example, every time 
that I submit my taxes, I take myself out 

134
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,310
to a really nice dinner at my favorite 
restaurant. 

135
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,862
Another way to do this is to set a 
contract ahead of time with yourself, 

136
00:07:38,862 --> 00:07:42,942
sometimes called Ulysses contracts. 
Where, if you don't do something that you 

137
00:07:42,942 --> 00:07:47,420
maybe want to do or need to do you will 
incur some kind of penalty. 

138
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,556
So a friend of mine, for example, had a 
deal with her husband, if she doesn't go 

139
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:53,937
to the gym three times a week, he ends up 
donating to the charity that she really, 

140
00:07:53,937 --> 00:07:58,200
really, doesn't like. 
And so this motivates her to go to the 

141
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,472
gym. 
But we can't use this for everything, 

142
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,760
right? 
Imagine you're already at dinner, you 

143
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,980
didn't set up a contract. 
But you really want to make sure that you 

144
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,180
don't get tempted by this luscious, 
wonderful cake that just arrived at your 

145
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,560
table. 
How do you do this? 

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,638
Is there a way in the moment to control 
your craving and delay your 

147
00:08:14,638 --> 00:08:17,572
gratification? 
Well, it turns out that even from these 

148
00:08:17,572 --> 00:08:20,850
Walter-Michele marshmallow experiments, 
we know that that's true. 

149
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,192
Right? 
Some kids could really wait as much as 15 

150
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:25,780
minutes. 
And so adults must be able to do that as 

151
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:28,90
well. 
Well, the cooler finding, I think, in 

152
00:08:28,90 --> 00:08:31,540
these marshmallow experiments, is that 
even the kids who couldn't wait, if the 

153
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,713
experimenter taught them some strategies 
right then and there. 

154
00:08:35,713 --> 00:08:38,360
Suddenly, they were able to wait much 
longer. 

155
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,710
Can we do the same thing with adults? 
Well, the first thing that's difficult to 

156
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,140
do with adults is to get them to really 
want marshmallows. 

157
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,490
So we can't get them to want to devour 
marshmallows, but we can tempt them with 

158
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,625
other kinds of foods. 
And this is really how food commercials 

159
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:53,290
work, right? 
You see an ad for this creamy, beautiful 

160
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:57,690
ice cream, and you think to 
yourself,[SOUND] that looks so good. 

161
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,770
I want to eat that right now. 
and so that's exactly what I did in some 

162
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,170
of the experiments that we ran in my lab. 
We show people pictures of food. 

163
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,390
We show cigarette smokers pictures of 
cigarettes. 

164
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,90
We take individuals who smoke crack 
cocaine and we show them pictures of 

165
00:09:10,90 --> 00:09:13,105
crack cocaine and other people smoking 
crack cocaine and what results is a state 

166
00:09:13,105 --> 00:09:15,910
of craving. 
They're really tempted. 

167
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,620
They want to eat. 
They want to smoke. 

168
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,871
What we do then is we teach them a very 
simple strategy for regulation of 

169
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:26,464
craving. 
We call this the Regulation of Craving 

170
00:09:26,464 --> 00:09:29,228
task or the ROC task. 
And what we tell them to do is we tell 

171
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:32,132
them to think about all the reasons that 
they have not to eat the chocolate cake, 

172
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:35,720
not to smoke cigarettes, not to smoke 
crack, right? 

173
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,580
Think about the negative consequences 
that they might incur if they engage in 

174
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,780
this behavior. 
so, for example. 

175
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,952
If I, if I were a participant in my own 
experiment, and I saw a picture of 

176
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,495
chocolate cake. 
I might think to myself, well it looks 

177
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:51,387
really good. 
But if I eat it it might be bad for my 

178
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:53,932
weight. 
It will probably over time, raise my 

179
00:09:53,932 --> 00:09:56,500
blood pressure. 
be bad for my health. 

180
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,90
I might have a higher risk of diabetes. 
It's really bad for me. 

181
00:09:59,90 --> 00:10:01,973
I really, really don't want to do this. 
Not to mention, I might feel bad about 

182
00:10:01,973 --> 00:10:05,210
myself if I eat this cake. 
And what did we find? 

183
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:10,420
We found that when individuals use this 
strategy to regulate their craving. 

184
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,579
they actually reported much lower 
craving. 

185
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,666
And even more than reporting lower 
craving, they reported that they wanted 

186
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,949
to eat this food less, they wanted to 
smoke less, they wanted to engage less in 

187
00:10:18,949 --> 00:10:23,670
these behaviors when they thought about 
these consequences. 

188
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:26,505
And then, when we looked at their brain 
activity, what we found is that using 

189
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:29,430
these techniques allows them to recruit 
parts of their brain, the prefrontal 

190
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,550
cortex, which we know is associated with 
better self control. 

191
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,180
And in turn what we saw is a reduction in 
brain activity in regions of their brain 

192
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:41,602
that we know gives rise to craving. 
So in using these strategies they were 

193
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:44,592
better able to control their craving and 
they were able to change the way their 

194
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:49,370
brain worked in that moment. 
Now, of course, it, this didn't work 

195
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,350
perfectly. 
It didn't work for everybody. 

196
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,450
But it worked for a lot of our 
participants. 

197
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:56,505
And so, this is something that you might 
want to try next time you're in that kind 

198
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:59,582
of situation. 
Now, the second thing that makes self 

199
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:02,798
control like a mental muscle, is the fact 
that the ability of this muscle might be 

200
00:11:02,798 --> 00:11:06,105
limited. 
For example, when you go to the gym you 

201
00:11:06,105 --> 00:11:08,985
maybe can do a certain set of exercises 
with the same muscle, but you can't 

202
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:12,780
really go on forever. 
And maybe after you finish being at the 

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,180
gym, you can't really lift as many heavy 
boxes as you would if you hadn't gone to 

204
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,692
the gym and exercised your muscle. 
Well, self control turns out to be 

205
00:11:20,692 --> 00:11:23,400
similar. 
There's now many, many studies that have 

206
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,140
shown, that when you use self-control 
later in the day, you might have a little 

207
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,78
bit less self-control available. 
and there are different ideas about why 

208
00:11:32,78 --> 00:11:35,378
this happens, but either way, what I want 
to tell you today is that you can really 

209
00:11:35,378 --> 00:11:40,372
anticipate that this is going to happen. 
Notice when you feel like people call 

210
00:11:40,372 --> 00:11:44,630
this depleted and that there are things 
that you can do to make this better. 

211
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,234
So for example one finding is that if 
people pace themselves, knowing that you 

212
00:11:48,234 --> 00:11:53,600
have to go to dinner tonight and exercise 
self-control in the face of dessert. 

213
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,188
you can pace yourself throughout the day 
and not use as many of your self control 

214
00:11:57,188 --> 00:12:00,360
resources so that you have some spare 
left. 

215
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,375
the second thing is that people found 
that positive emotion reverse this effect 

216
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:07,152
of depletion. 
So if you feel like you've already 

217
00:12:07,152 --> 00:12:09,924
exercised a lot of self control, maybe 
you don't have a lot left right in this 

218
00:12:09,924 --> 00:12:13,570
moment. 
you can watch a funny movie. 

219
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,108
It turns out that, after this funny 
movie, a lot of people show kind of a 

220
00:12:17,108 --> 00:12:22,4
return of this self control strength. 
The third finding that had come out 

221
00:12:22,4 --> 00:12:25,532
fairly recently, is the idea that 
individuals who believe that exercising 

222
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:30,110
self control won't deplete them, don't 
get quite as depleted. 

223
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,509
And you can try to do this, in your own 
time. 

224
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,30
The third and I think most amazing way in 
which self-control is like a muscle is 

225
00:12:38,30 --> 00:12:41,896
the fact that you can train it. 
Now, we know from clinical psychology 

226
00:12:41,896 --> 00:12:45,570
that there are treatments that help 
individuals exercise better self-control. 

227
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,296
For example, in a treatment called 
cognitive behavioral therapy for 

228
00:12:48,296 --> 00:12:51,492
addictions or substance abuse disorders, 
individuals who use drugs learn how to 

229
00:12:51,492 --> 00:12:56,120
use the same strategy that I told you 
about just a few minutes ago. 

230
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,330
to reduce their craving for drugs, and 
reduce their drug use. 

231
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,380
And indeed that kind of treatment is one 
of the best treatments we have for 

232
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,778
addiction. 
And in a finding from Cathy Carol's lab 

233
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:09,418
at Yale we recently learned that those 
individuals who learn how to to use a 

234
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:13,367
strategy the best at the end of 
treatment. 

235
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:17,119
Are also those individuals who end up 
using the least drugs and doing the best 

236
00:13:17,119 --> 00:13:20,710
over time. 
we also have shown that individuals who 

237
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:24,358
undergo this treatment actually show 
changes in the prefrontal cortex from 

238
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:28,705
before to after treatment. 
With a prefront, their prefrontal cortex 

239
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,331
actually becomes more efficient after 
treatment. 

240
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,19
So more able to carry out these self 
control operations. 

241
00:13:35,40 --> 00:13:38,368
But of course, these treatments are 
complex they're long, they often happen 

242
00:13:38,368 --> 00:13:42,838
over the course of several months. 
What about briefer training self-control, 

243
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:46,456
can that help if you don't go through an 
entire treatment that have other kinds of 

244
00:13:46,456 --> 00:13:50,369
components to it? 
Well luckily, we have evidence now, that 

245
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:54,780
there's shorter kinds of training you can 
do to improve your self-control. 

246
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,770
For example, in a series of studies that 
we recently completed in my lab, we've 

247
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:01,972
shown that with half an hour of training. 
using the kind of strategy that I told 

248
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:05,710
you about we can train cigarette smokers 
to regulate their craving. 

249
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,842
And over the course of the next two 
weeks, with just half an hour of 

250
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:13,466
training, they report smoking a lot less. 
So we are able to help individuals 

251
00:14:13,466 --> 00:14:17,310
control their smoking by training them in 
using this particular strategy. 

252
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:20,162
Now, of course, this is a very direct 
kind of practice, right, you practice 

253
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:23,60
using a strategy To regulate your 
craving, and you get better at regulating 

254
00:14:23,60 --> 00:14:27,442
your craving and you smoke less. 
But it turns out that there's also 

255
00:14:27,442 --> 00:14:31,256
indirect training that you can do. 
And training in smalls acts of self 

256
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:34,766
control can also strengthen your self 
control muscle and help you have better 

257
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:38,714
self control in general. 
So what are some examples? 

258
00:14:38,714 --> 00:14:44,244
some researchers have asked people to 
turn open doors or open cabinets for an 

259
00:14:44,244 --> 00:14:49,605
entire week with their non-dominant hand. 
So if you're right-handed, you would do 

260
00:14:49,605 --> 00:14:51,810
this with your left hand, if you're 
left-handed, you would do this with your 

261
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,501
right hand. 
And it turns out that at the end of this 

262
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:57,870
week, people were better at exercising 
self-control in general. 

263
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,59
Other kinds of exercises include going to 
the gym regularly, refraining from eating 

264
00:15:02,59 --> 00:15:07,393
sweets and even using a hand grip. 
All of these kind of training improve 

265
00:15:07,393 --> 00:15:11,445
self-control in general. 
Of course, nothing that I told you today 

266
00:15:11,445 --> 00:15:14,996
will help you if you're missing one key 
ingredient, and that is the motivation to 

267
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:18,86
change. 
Well it turns out, that if you don't have 

268
00:15:18,86 --> 00:15:21,600
the motivation to change, how are you 
going to learn the right techniques? 

269
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,608
and if you do have the motivation to 
change not only can you learn the right 

270
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:27,771
techniques, but you can apply them in the 
moment. 

271
00:15:27,771 --> 00:15:30,638
You can prepare yourself for being 
depleted and counteract it if you need 

272
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,836
to. 
And of course, practice, practice, 

273
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:36,430
practice to increase your self-control. 
this is the one thing that you are 

274
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,661
supposed to remember from this lecture. 
If you want to, you can work to have 

275
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:44,27
better self-control. 
And to illustrate this importance of 

276
00:15:44,27 --> 00:15:47,420
motivation, I'm going to tell you the one 
joke that I know to tell. 

277
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,819
How many psychologists does it take to 
change a light bulb? 

278
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,560
One, but only if the light bulb really 
wants to change. 

279
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:06,613
Thank you and good luck.
