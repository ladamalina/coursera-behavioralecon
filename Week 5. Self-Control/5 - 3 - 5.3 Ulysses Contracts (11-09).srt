1
00:00:00,812 --> 00:00:08,586
So, we said we have self-control problems,
and we need self-control solutions.

2
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:15,722
And the first type of solution we
identify, we call reward substitution.

3
00:00:15,722 --> 00:00:21,202
The second type of solution I want to talk
about it what we call self control

4
00:00:21,202 --> 00:00:25,542
contracts, or Ulysses contracts.
And you probably remember the story of

5
00:00:25,542 --> 00:00:29,190
Ulysses and the sirens.
And the story is that Ulysses knew that if

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,060
the sirens will sing, he will follow them.
So what did he do?

7
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,524
He asked the sailors to tie him to the
mast, and not to let him go, and he asked

8
00:00:37,524 --> 00:00:41,812
the sailors to put donag in their ears.
And if you think about it, those are two

9
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:45,623
different solutions that are very
different from reward substitution.

10
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:50,349
Ulysses himself wanted to hear the sirens,
but not to be tempted.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,537
And the sailors, you want them not to be
tempted at all.

12
00:00:54,538 --> 00:00:59,023
If you think about it in modern times,
it's as if Ulysses himself put his cell

13
00:00:59,023 --> 00:01:03,709
phone in the trunk so he could hear his
phone ringing but he couldn't approach it

14
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:06,870
while driving.
And for the sailors, he basically turned

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,230
the phone off so they were not even
tempted.

16
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,229
And you can think to yourself which one is
the right one for you.

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,583
But what's important here is that it is
very different from reward substitution

18
00:01:18,583 --> 00:01:22,571
because you know up-front that you're
going to be tempted.

19
00:01:22,571 --> 00:01:28,409
You know that something will get you to
turn you from the rightful path and you're

20
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,890
willing to do something now that would
bind your future self to not be able to

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,332
behave badly.
So think to yourself for a minute, can you

22
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:46,094
think about cases in which you have done
something that basically made your future

23
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:50,574
self unable to behave badly?
Here are some examples that I, I hear from

24
00:01:50,574 --> 00:01:53,326
people.
So, for example, often people, when they

25
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:57,480
make an appointment with a personal
trainer i the gym, they prepay them and

26
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,902
the condition is that you can't cancel it
and many people said that if they could

27
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:06,458
cancel their appointment with the gym
trainer, they would call 10 minutes before

28
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:10,679
and say, you know what, I don't want to
show up today give me my money back, but

29
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,665
the fact that they have paid for it,
forces them to go.

30
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:18,714
Similar, people sometimes buy these 100
calorie cookie packs.

31
00:02:18,714 --> 00:02:20,200
Why?
They're really expensive.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,432
Why not buy the big bag?
Well, we think that if we buy the big bag,

33
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:27,741
we'll eat many cookies.
But if they'll buy small packs, maybe

34
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:33,790
we'll eat just a few.
And similarly, my undergrads.

35
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:38,300
They often tell me that when they get to
exam week, and they want to make sure that

36
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,720
they study and not play on Facebook, they
give their computers to a friend and they

37
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,815
ask them to log in to their Facebook
account and to change their password and

38
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:50,670
not to tell them what the new password is
until after exam week is over.

39
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,971
This way they basically prevent
themselves.

40
00:02:52,972 --> 00:02:57,658
From misbehaving.
Undergrads also tell me that instead of

41
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:02,833
working in their dorm room, where they
have quiet and flexibility, they sometimes

42
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,928
go to the library or to a public space to
work.

43
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:08,418
Why?
Because they think that if other people

44
00:03:08,418 --> 00:03:12,576
watch them, they will not feel as free
either to sleep or to do things that are

45
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:16,010
not work-related or study-related.
On the computers.

46
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,840
In a very domain, different domain by the
way, eh, my MBA students, the females, eh,

47
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,390
told me a couple of times that if they go
on a date and they don't want things to go

48
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,730
too far out of hands, they wear very ugly
underwear which also inhibits the

49
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,356
probability that something bad or
something unplanned.

50
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:38,166
Would happen down the road.
So think about all of those self control

51
00:03:38,166 --> 00:03:41,614
contracts.
Those are all kinds of things that we do

52
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:45,465
naturally.
Now,[cough] before we go and think further

53
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:50,673
about this, I want to go back and I want
to tell you a little bit about some old

54
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:57,032
experiments about pigeons and rats.
So imagine you're either a pigeon or a rat

55
00:03:57,032 --> 00:04:01,700
and imagine that I teach you two things.
I teach you that if you see a green and

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,210
you press on it, you get one pellet of
food immediately.

57
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:09,818
But if you see a purple button, you have
to wait ten seconds and then you get ten

58
00:04:09,818 --> 00:04:14,426
pellets of food and you study this for a
very, very, very long period and you know

59
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:18,496
it very, very well.
And now all of a sudden I show you both of

60
00:04:18,496 --> 00:04:23,606
them together, which one do you chose, one
immediate or you chose to wait ten seconds

61
00:04:23,606 --> 00:04:27,824
and get ten pellets of food?
And before you make your prediction, I

62
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:32,829
should just tell you that ten seconds for
a pigeon and a rat is like a week for us,

63
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:36,160
well maybe not a week but its a long, long
time for us.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,079
So its a really tough decision, so what do
you think they chose?

65
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:43,145
They choose the green.
They choose the immediate reward and they

66
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:46,490
forgot the larger delayed reward.
It gets likely worse.

67
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,170
You start a trial, the problem button
comes up and they press on it.

68
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:54,660
A little bit of time passes and then the
green button tap, comes up.

69
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,377
If they can only hold off, if they can
only you know, sit on their paws, resist

70
00:04:58,377 --> 00:05:02,557
temptation, do something.
They would get the ten pellets of food,

71
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:03,766
but can they?
No.

72
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:08,916
They pressed the green button and they
forego the ten pieces of food for the

73
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:12,950
benefit of getting one immediate now.
But here's the most interesting thing.

74
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,326
The trial starts, the purple button
appears and it's a little time after that

75
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:23,954
a red button appears and the red button is
not connected to food but the red button

76
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:28,281
could turn off the green button.
Now it takes a while to learn that that's

77
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:31,401
what it does.
But the red button turns off the green

78
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,688
button.
That's theorisist's contract.

79
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:38,254
That's the question of when the rats and
pigeons will put effort into something

80
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,827
that they don't like In order to prevent
their future self from being tempted.

81
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:45,707
So what do you think?
Would rats and pigeons do it?

82
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:49,722
Would they invest energy in something they
don't like to prevent their future self

83
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:52,347
from misbehaving?
The answer is yes.

84
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:56,518
They don't do it all the time, but they do
it quite frequently, and I think this is

85
00:05:56,518 --> 00:06:00,814
incredibly optimistic.
First of all, if rats and pigeons can do

86
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:03,060
it, maybe we can do it too.
That's the first good news.

87
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,244
The second good news is it is all about
thinking about the world in terms of red

88
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,209
button.
If you take a pigeon and you tempt it,

89
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:15,295
it's going to be temped.
You get a rat, you tempt it, it's going to

90
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,812
fail.
And I saw the same thing, we are just not

91
00:06:17,812 --> 00:06:21,804
good in temptation.
But, sometimes we are going to think

92
00:06:21,804 --> 00:06:26,927
up-front and we are giving the right
tools, we might behave well.

93
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:31,896
By the way, when we think about
temptation, we sometimes divide people

94
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:36,072
into two types.
What we call naive and sophisticate.

95
00:06:36,072 --> 00:06:39,170
The naive people are people who don't
think they are going to be tempted.

96
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:43,391
They are people who say oh, I have no
problems with procrastination and self

97
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:47,746
control and overeating when they get to
that situation and the way to ask me if I

98
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:51,466
want the chocolate souffle dessert, I can
easily say no to them.

99
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:56,511
The sophisticated people are the ones who
say, I know that when the time will come,

100
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,395
I will be tempted and because of that, I
am willing to take steps now to prevent my

101
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:05,812
future self from being tempted.
And if you think about it maybe if we

102
00:07:05,812 --> 00:07:11,350
educated people to a higher extent, about
our self control problem, and created more

103
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,637
red buttons, created more ways for us to
bypass our temptations.

104
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:18,257
Maybe people would behave much, much
better.

105
00:07:18,257 --> 00:07:24,319
So let me give you some examples for this.
The first example is this alarm clock

106
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,359
called Clocky.
And Clocky is an alarm clock designed by

107
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:31,866
one of the students in the media lab.
The one on the left was, the original

108
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:34,670
version.
And the one on the right is a commercial

109
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,970
version.
A little less cuddly, but still useful.

110
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:41,114
And you see the red.
The, the big, the big wheels.

111
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:45,929
And what happens with clock is, has two
big wheels that run in slightly different

112
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,787
speeds.
Now what happened?

113
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:52,222
When you go to sleep you set up your alarm
clock for 6 o'clock in the morning and in

114
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:56,577
your mind you're the kind of person who
gets up at 6 o'clock in the morning and go

115
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:00,254
for a run before you go to school or
before you go to work.

116
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:04,787
But what happens when 6 o'clock in the
morning actually comes around?

117
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:07,940
The reality is that you're probably no
longer that person.

118
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:12,437
Now you're a person who kind of looks for
the snooze button, but if you have Clocky,

119
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:16,620
Clocky also starts running around.
The moment the alarm starts up it runs

120
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,210
around the room and you have to go and
chase it and run after it.

121
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:24,448
It's unpredictable because there's a
random component to it and not only that.

122
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:29,592
But the snooze button is really, really,
really below the clock and you, you have

123
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:33,478
to find it and flip it over and find where
the snooze button is.

124
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:37,454
And by the time you find clock and you
hunt it down, you know what?

125
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:41,176
You are awake.
And therefore you might actually go for a

126
00:08:41,176 --> 00:08:43,910
run.
The design flaw, what I think is a fatal

127
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:49,002
design flaw of clock, by the way, is that
by the time you're Up, and you found clock

128
00:08:49,002 --> 00:08:52,107
and you hunted it down, you're also pissed
off.

129
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:56,085
So if you do an image search online,
you'll find lots of pictures of clocks

130
00:08:56,085 --> 00:09:00,635
with the wheels torn off which of course,
don't represent very well this benefit for

131
00:09:00,635 --> 00:09:05,022
self-control.
And now I think that they're going to an

132
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:10,190
earlier design by another friend of mine
which basically made more of an egg shape

133
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,160
version which could basically not be
broken.

134
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,174
No parts to break when you're angry with
the clock.

135
00:09:16,174 --> 00:09:20,930
There's another version I like even more.
This is a version that never became

136
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,819
commercial, but the idea is great.
It's an alarm clock called snooze and

137
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:28,542
lose.
And it's an alarm clock that is connected

138
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,899
to your bank account.
And not only to a bank account, but it's

139
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,652
connected to a charity you hate.
Now here it is, you get this alarm clock

140
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:40,468
and you set it up.
Now what would happen if you connected it

141
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:43,770
to a charity you liked?
Now if the alarm clock goes off, you could

142
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:47,235
say to yourself, ooh, I get to snooze,
plus I get to give money to trees, let's

143
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:50,670
say.
But if you're sophisticated, you

144
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,025
understand how self control works, then
you might sell it to give to, to a charity

145
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:58,050
you really hate, and now there's no way
you can snooze.

146
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,956
There's no way you can sleep, and think to
yourself that every second you're

147
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:05,924
sleeping, some money, even very, very
small amount, is going to somebody you

148
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:09,550
really, really hate.
There's other examples for this.

149
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,541
One of those is a website that I really
like called Stickk.

150
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:18,564
And I highly recommend that you try and
visit it and try experimenting with it.

151
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:23,750
Now, we did a couple of experiments on
this.

152
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,210
One of them included a Chinese restaurant
called Panda Express, in which we tried to

153
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,202
see whether people are willing, in
advance, to limit their ordering in order

154
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:38,609
to force their future self to eat less.
And the answer was that yes, that people

155
00:10:38,609 --> 00:10:42,120
were doing it quite successfully.
We looked at whether people would be

156
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,216
willing to pay in advance For medical
procedures, in a way that they would get

157
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:50,312
the money back if they showed up for the
medical procedure, but not if they got

158
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:52,900
late, and so on and people are willing to
do it.

159
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,784
So I think there's a lot of opportunities
to think about how this would work out,

160
00:10:57,784 --> 00:11:00,979
and introducing such mechanisms into the
market.
