1
00:00:00,603 --> 00:00:06,383
There are some other questions you might
ask about self control and particularly

2
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:11,592
about individual differences.
So, we're talking about a few of those

3
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:15,468
things.
First there is a very, very interesting

4
00:00:15,468 --> 00:00:22,112
set of experiments and results done mostly
by Walter Mischel and his colleagues.

5
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:28,322
And this has to do with how self control
behaves as a trait over time.

6
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:32,126
And what they did was what's commonly
known as a marshmallow test.

7
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:36,157
They took a kid at age 3, 4, 5, 6, and so
on and they put them in a room.

8
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:40,130
And they said hey kid, you can have this
little marshmallow right now, or little

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,730
cookie, but if you wait for 10 minutes a
nice lady will come with 2 of those

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,646
things.
And they basically looked at the, at the

11
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:49,640
kids.
And what was interesting is that the kids

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,483
who were able to resist temptation did
better in college.

13
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,318
Why?
Because resisting temptation is this

14
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:59,190
general ability.
It's something that if we can do with

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,850
cookies, we might be able to do with
friends going to a party, drinking too

16
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,439
much, procrastination, all kinds of other
things.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,462
There's some other similar research done
at Duke recently, showing that this also

18
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:17,727
connects to healthcare outcome and
criminal records, and also to the ability

19
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:22,074
to maintain good standing in terms of
financial health.

20
00:01:22,074 --> 00:01:27,309
So, self control, even at the young age,
seems to be highly predictive of the

21
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:30,462
ability to have self control, in later
ages.

22
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:34,680
Now, what's also interesting is that, if
you look at the videos from Walter

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,372
Mischel's experiments, it's not as if the
kids were able to just look at the cookie,

24
00:01:39,372 --> 00:01:42,227
and not care about it.
They played all kinds of tricks for

25
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,190
themselves.
They sat on their hands.

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,470
They looked up.
They sang songs to themselves.

27
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,673
They basically found ways to distract
themselves.

28
00:01:49,673 --> 00:01:54,409
Now, think about those two paths.
Where is this self control coming from?

29
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:59,736
Is it about a skill, some trait, or is it
about the ability to play tricks on

30
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:03,365
ourselves?
Maybe it's a combination of the two.

31
00:02:03,366 --> 00:02:08,170
In, in religious terms you can think about
is it will or is it grace.

32
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,974
Is it something that we're just born with?
We just don't care about cookies.

33
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:16,605
Or is it something that we could force
ourselves to do by actually distracting

34
00:02:16,605 --> 00:02:20,041
ourselves?
I think that right now the results point

35
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,916
more into the distracting part, which
means that even if we don't think we have

36
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:30,091
self control, we might still have a future
because we might be able to create tricks

37
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:34,267
that allow us to bypass those temptations
that lie in front of us.

38
00:02:34,268 --> 00:02:39,590
So that's eh, the first thing about these
skill and, and about, where is it coming

39
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,656
from, this ability to resist temptation?
The other thing is that there's a really

40
00:02:44,656 --> 00:02:49,408
interesting set of results by Baumeister,
Roy Baumeister and, and his, and his

41
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:52,222
colleague about what's called ego
depletion.

42
00:02:52,222 --> 00:02:57,546
And what they're saying is that as you go
ahead and resist temptation throughout the

43
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:01,337
day, its becoming harder and harder to
resist temptation.

44
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:05,004
So, you see something you want to buy and
you don't buy it and you resist

45
00:03:05,004 --> 00:03:07,361
temptation.
And you see a muffin and you want it but

46
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,097
you resist temptation.
And you go ahead and you do more and more

47
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,337
this.
Youtube and there's email and saying

48
00:03:12,337 --> 00:03:16,455
something nasty for your boss.
And as you resist the temptation all the

49
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:20,765
time, your willpower dwindles.
And, and Roy is thinking about it like a,

50
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,318
like a weight.
You resist temptation, you resist

51
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,670
temptation you resist away.
And slowly, slowly you weigh at your, your

52
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:32,827
wear it, at your ability to resist
temptation and eventually eh, we fail.

53
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:38,040
So this, by the way, suggests that if you
have tasks that require self control,

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,400
maybe it's good to do them early in the
morning, rather than do them late in the

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,727
afternoon, when you would be perhaps more,
more depleted.

56
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,986
There's one more really interesting
result, and it's about the fact that

57
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:58,662
religious Jews who are smokers don't,
don't seem to be tempted by smoking on the

58
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:01,708
Sabbath.
And this is kind of very strange because

59
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,678
if you think to yourself that smoking is a
physiological reaction, how can it be that

60
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:10,920
on the Sabbath they're not tempted?
And the idea is that there are some things

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,504
that we know are outside of our
considerations.

62
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:18,837
There's this theory in religious thought
that its about the decision point.

63
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:23,842
It says that if you get people from the
non-religious to their religious what

64
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:27,237
changes is what people consider as an
option or not.

65
00:04:27,238 --> 00:04:30,670
If you're an Orthodox Jew, you're not
going to think about smoking on the

66
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,278
Sabbath is it all possible.
In the same way that you would not think

67
00:04:34,278 --> 00:04:36,480
about eating a cheesecake after you ate a
steak.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,479
It's just not possible.
And once those things are not possible,

69
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,435
they don't seem to tempt us in the same
way.

70
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:47,658
And now, the question for us, of course,
in society is where do we want to have

71
00:04:47,658 --> 00:04:50,766
this decision point.
The more freedom we have, the more

72
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:54,660
ability, to be tempted.
We have in the more potential for failing.

73
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,780
And the less freedom we have, the more
restricted our choices are but the less

74
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,418
chances there are that we would fail.
So anyway, think about those, those issues

75
00:05:04,418 --> 00:05:07,882
in terms of personality.
What is our inherent ability for self

76
00:05:07,882 --> 00:05:11,004
control?
And how much of it comes from pure ability

77
00:05:11,004 --> 00:05:15,830
versus ways in which we taught ourselves
to have tricks, to trick ourselves?

78
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:20,380
Think about what happened to self-control,
our ability to resist temptation

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,167
throughout the day and as we fight
temptation.

80
00:05:23,168 --> 00:05:26,186
And think about what is the role of the
rules around us?

81
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:28,870
And what we find is acceptable and not
acceptable.

82
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,720
It's both tempting us and also weighing at
our ability for self control.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,767
So, what does all of this tell us about
self control?

84
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:42,367
First of all, we need to recognize that we
have lots of Adam and Eve problems.

85
00:05:42,367 --> 00:05:47,537
And not only we have them, but they're
going to get more and more over time.

86
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:51,222
Think about it.
The world around us, the commercial world

87
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,749
around us, wants our time, attention, and
money, right now.

88
00:05:54,749 --> 00:05:59,537
Who wants us to do something that is good
for us in the long term?

89
00:05:59,538 --> 00:06:03,227
Maybe long term financial savings and
maybe preventative health.

90
00:06:03,228 --> 00:06:06,551
But of course, in most cases, we don't
have preventative health.

91
00:06:06,551 --> 00:06:09,976
The other thing to realize is the
environment in which we're being placed

92
00:06:09,976 --> 00:06:14,541
has a lot to do with our decisions.
And what is the commercial environment

93
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,655
around us?
It's all about tempting us to behave in a

94
00:06:17,655 --> 00:06:21,644
way that is good for them right now, and
not necessarily for us.

95
00:06:21,644 --> 00:06:25,250
So this means that not only do we have
lots of Adam and Eve problems, we're

96
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,950
probably going to have more of them.
As the commercial world around us become

97
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,909
more sophisticated, we're probably going
to be tempted to a higher degree.

98
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,997
The next version of the Doughnut, Doughnut
2.0.

99
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:41,265
Is it going to be more tempting or less
tempting than the Doughnut we have right

100
00:06:41,265 --> 00:06:43,626
now?
Most likely, more tempting.

101
00:06:43,626 --> 00:06:47,144
The next version of Facebook.
Is it going to tempt us more or less to go

102
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:51,000
into Facebook all the time and check our
profile and messages and so on?

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,030
Probably more likely, because Facebook
wants us to come back and back and back

104
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,897
all the time and they control the
environment in which we make decisions.

105
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:03,535
Is the next version of the smart phone
going to tempt us more or less to text

106
00:07:03,535 --> 00:07:07,040
while driving or to check our messages
while driving?

107
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,052
Probably more.
So, not only do we have self control

108
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:14,533
problems, they're likely to get larger and
larger over time.

109
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:21,801
And because of this, things like Ulysses
contracts are incredibly important.

110
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:25,897
It would be nice if all of us could design
our own rewards substitution and our own

111
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:29,350
Ulysses contracts, but the reality is that
it is incredibly hard.

112
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:34,107
It's incredibly hard to imagine that we
could design those mechanisms for every

113
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:38,060
one of the many, many temptations than we
face in our daily lives.

114
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,495
But instead, I think the hope is in the
red button.

115
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:47,630
The hope is that people will design
software and hardware and reward

116
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:52,237
substitutions that would help us deal with
the world as it is.

117
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:59,638
Now, this is again tremendously important.
There was a very sad analysis that looked

118
00:07:59,638 --> 00:08:06,052
about, that looked at why people die.
And specifically at, how many deaths can

119
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:11,022
be attributed to bad decision making.
And when you look at the statistics and

120
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,860
you try to estimate many, many years ago,
like 100 years ago.

121
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,204
What was the percentage of human mortality
that was caused by bad decision making?

122
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,730
And it's about ten.
You can think about the hundred years ago,

123
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:26,626
what mistakes could you make in decision
making that would lead to some death,

124
00:08:26,626 --> 00:08:28,927
after all?
Not that bad.

125
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:33,410
The percentage more recently, when you try
to estimate it, is over 40%.

126
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:37,223
Why?
Because as we invent new technologies, we

127
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:40,977
also invent ways to kill ourselves.
Think about it.

128
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:46,040
Obesity, diabetes, smoking, texting and
driving.

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,332
As we invent these new technology the
challenge of decision making to be at a

130
00:08:51,332 --> 00:08:54,997
much higher level we have much opportunity
to fail.

131
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:58,763
If you text and walk what can happen?
Not much.

132
00:08:58,763 --> 00:09:02,610
You text and drive at 70 miles per hour
with other cars doing the same thing.

133
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,260
Now you're in real danger.
So as we advance in technology, and as we

134
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,670
don't take our cognitive limitations into
account, we create more and more

135
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,655
opportunities for us to fail.
And because of that, we need to understand

136
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,149
self control problem and think very
carefully about how to solve it.

137
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,932
The final thing I want to talk about is
the challenges of self control mechanisms,

138
00:09:26,932 --> 00:09:31,667
particularly for Ulysses contracts, in
terms of ideology.

139
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:35,750
And there's a story that talks about the
Denver Drug Program.

140
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,229
And the data is very sketchy, but here's
how the story goes in general.

141
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,846
This was a drug program that took heroin
addicts and asked them, heroin addicts, do

142
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:49,760
you want to be heroin addicts?
And the heroin addict said no, not a good

143
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,530
life, not really interested in living my
life this way.

144
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,430
And they said to them, why don't you, the
heroin addict, write a self-incriminating

145
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,050
letter about your drug habit and address
it to the person you feel most will find

146
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,490
out about your drug addiction?
People wrote this letter.

147
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,148
If it was me, I would write, dear mom.
Really, really sorry to tell you I have a

148
00:10:10,148 --> 00:10:11,752
drug habit.
Love, Dan.

149
00:10:11,753 --> 00:10:14,080
And then, this non for profit would take
the letter.

150
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,960
They would fold it.
They would put it in an envelope.

151
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,177
The would put a stamp.
They would address it.

152
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:22,853
But they would hold it in trust.
And they would come from time to time and

153
00:10:22,853 --> 00:10:27,681
they would do blood tests and searches in
the person's apartment and if they ever,

154
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:31,537
ever, ever found traces of drugs they will
mail the letter away.

155
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:35,190
This is the Ulysses contract.
This is saying that when I'm in a cold

156
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,130
state, not interested in being a drug
addict, I am doing something so big and so

157
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,940
powerful that would hopefully influence my
future self from taking drugs.

158
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,184
I'm basically trying to bind my ability in
the future to behave badly and not pay

159
00:10:50,184 --> 00:10:54,512
dramatic, painful, cost for that.
What happened?

160
00:10:54,512 --> 00:10:57,716
Lots of people signed up.
These were people who were not craving

161
00:10:57,716 --> 00:11:00,649
drugs at the moment, but then people
started craving drugs.

162
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,490
So what happened?
They came to this not-for-profit and say,

163
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:07,279
we want out.
And what is this not-for-profit said?

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,646
Fine, in three weeks.
But for now, we're going to test you every

165
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:13,102
day.
We know you're in a craving state so we're

166
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:16,586
going to test you every day.
And three weeks are a substantial amount

167
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:19,340
of time to get over initial stages of drug
addiction.

168
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,828
And they said that after that immediate
time, very few of those people wanted to

169
00:11:23,828 --> 00:11:26,613
get up.
Now, eventually, this program had to be

170
00:11:26,613 --> 00:11:30,612
cancelled mostly because of reasons of
violation of human rights.

171
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:32,750
And that's kind of the issue with Ulysses
contracts.

172
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,995
Think about it.
I can probably get you to sign a contract

173
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:40,030
that would create tremendous damage to
yourself if you misbehave.

174
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:44,645
But the only way this contract is going to
be effective is if you can't get out of

175
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:48,898
it, because if you can get out of it, how
is it ever going to be effective?

176
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:52,064
Right?
And because of that we really have to ask

177
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:55,033
ourselves.
How do we deal with this complexity of

178
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:59,559
human freedom on one hand and human
ability to get into trouble on the other

179
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,879
hand?
Where do we stand on those cases?

180
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:05,848
There is no question that Ulysses
contracts, particularly big one, can get

181
00:12:05,848 --> 00:12:09,900
people to promise and actually commit for
their future self to behave well.

182
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,941
But these incredible punishments can also
be incredibly damaging if people fail and

183
00:12:14,941 --> 00:12:20,190
how do we, how do we think about.
And this is also, by the way, why we as

184
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:24,360
researchers have a very hard time studying
eh, Ulysses contracts.

185
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,762
Because the way we do experiments,
basically require us to allow people to

186
00:12:28,762 --> 00:12:31,544
get out of the experiment at each point in
time.

187
00:12:31,544 --> 00:12:36,293
So, the issue is that we really have to
think about what do we care about in terms

188
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:40,193
of human freedom, and how much are we
willing to impose on that?

189
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:45,393
What kind of mistakes are we willing to
and take as so important we can override

190
00:12:45,393 --> 00:12:49,079
human freedom?
And what mistakes are we willing to let

191
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,381
people continue with in the name of
freedom?

192
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:58,009
So that's it for today, and as you go
throughout the rest of your the next hour,

193
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:02,310
day, maybe week.
Think about all the cases in which you're

194
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,510
tempted to misbehave and try to think
about how you're going to overcome those

195
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:25,534
right now.
And what kind of tools would help you to

196
00:13:25,534 --> 00:13:48,539
overcome those temptations in the future?
