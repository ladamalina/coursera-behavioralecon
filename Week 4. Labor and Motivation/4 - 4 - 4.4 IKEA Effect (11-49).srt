1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
I'm sure that many of your are familiar
with IKEA.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,680
It's a store for kind of semi-assembled
furniture.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,553
You buy it and you get to assemble the
rest of it yourself.

4
00:00:15,553 --> 00:00:21,170
And quite a few years ago, I bought the
piece of furniture from Ikea.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:27,063
It was a particular, a chest for toys.
Nothing high quality, nothing particularly

6
00:00:27,063 --> 00:00:29,693
great.
And I also have to admit that I'm really

7
00:00:29,693 --> 00:00:33,427
bad at assembling things.
My hands are not that good to start with.

8
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:35,946
I never exactly understand the
instructions.

9
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:40,703
And as a consequence, I spend the whole
afternoon, maybe even the whole Afternoon

10
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:44,984
into the evening assembling these things.
I made lots of mistakes, I put things in

11
00:00:44,984 --> 00:00:48,632
the wrong pieces, I had to take things
apart and there were some screws I could

12
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:51,468
never find the right size according to the
instructions.

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:57,220
Anyway, it wasn't it wasn't a good
afternoon But what I found later is that I

14
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,124
kind of fell in love with a particular
chest of toys.

15
00:01:01,124 --> 00:01:05,870
And I kept on carrying it with me, I have
been moving a lot of round.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,570
And I kept on moving it and I kind of fond
of it.

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:14,355
And last night I looked at it again fondly
thinking about the hours that I spent

18
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:18,618
working on it.
Now, it's not that I'm mis-remembering the

19
00:01:18,618 --> 00:01:21,683
agony of building it but I do like it
more.

20
00:01:21,684 --> 00:01:26,880
And I started to think about what are
cases in which putting effort into

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,323
something makes you love it to a higher
degree.

22
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:35,578
Now, this actually reflects an old story.
And it's a story that when people started

23
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:41,019
creating cake mixes there was this idea
that housewives would love this thing.

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,900
And they were already selling mixers for
all kinds of things.

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,454
They were selling mixers for pie crust,
and for muffins, and for all kinds of

26
00:01:48,454 --> 00:01:50,867
other things.
Why not cakes?

27
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:54,990
But the reality was that, people did not
like the cake mixes.

28
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:59,790
They were just not desirable.
And the first thought that was, maybe the

29
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,320
taste was not good.
But no, the taste was great.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,597
And then they came up with something they
called the egg theory.

31
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:12,171
And the egg theory was if you take powder,
and you mix it with water, and you pour it

32
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:16,607
into a pan and you bake it, you cannot
really take credit for it.

33
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:21,666
It is not yours in any way.
Now, pie crust if you make a pie with

34
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:26,617
pre-made pie crust or from a mix, you
still made the pie.

35
00:02:26,618 --> 00:02:30,670
If you make biscuits or muffins, its still
just part of the breakfast.

36
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,609
But a cake is a whole dish, its the final
dish of the meal.

37
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,070
And all of a sudden, you basically are
saying, this is not mine.

38
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,864
I just poured it in and serve it to you.
Maybe it feels a bit like opening a can of

39
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:46,980
something.
Pouring it in, and serving it to your

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,878
guest.
So what would happen, they thought, if

41
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,220
they took the egg out of the mix, and took
the milk powder out of the mix.

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,710
And people had to add those things
together.

43
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,285
All of a sudden, it became much more
popular.

44
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:04,284
Which ironically means that we can make
something more effort full and less,

45
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:07,816
nevertheless people would like it to a
higher degree.

46
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:13,667
So, think about this idea that our liking
for something is determined not by, just

47
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,299
by what it is but also how much effort we
put into it.

48
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,060
And the most effort we put into something,
the more we like it.

49
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,366
So that was the basic idea and here is
what we try to do, we try to test it

50
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:28,970
empirically.
So we gave people a sheet of instructions

51
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,931
of how to do origami, how to do this
Japanese folding ah[COUGH] little animals.

52
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:40,805
And people could create a crane, or they
could create a frog and we gave them some

53
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:44,149
time to do it.
And the reality is that what people

54
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:48,352
created was not that good, right?
These were amateurs in origami.

55
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,431
They created some stuff.
It looked more like crumpled piece of

56
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:55,069
paper than a beautiful crane or frog, but
nevertheless they created it.

57
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,280
So we had these people who created these
frogs or crane.

58
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,310
And then we took other people who did not
create those frogs or crane.

59
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,738
And we asked them to evaluate them.
So we asked everybody who was a builder to

60
00:04:07,738 --> 00:04:12,719
basically say how much money they would be
willing to pay to get this crane or frog.

61
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,823
Because they work for us, so we are
officially we own the frogs and the

62
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,355
cranes.
But we told them we would be willing to

63
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:24,842
sell it to them for the right price.
And we create a little auction mechanism.

64
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:28,360
So what happened?
The first thing that happened was that the

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,880
builders thought that these were going to
be great and they were willing to pay a

66
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,594
lot of money for them.
The evaluators, not so much.

67
00:04:38,595 --> 00:04:42,300
The value it is that don't think that
those were great cranes.

68
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,578
So the moment you invested and you created
the crane or frog, you thought your crane

69
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:50,918
or frog was really fantastic.
When it wasn't you, you didn't think that

70
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,326
this was so such a, such a hot thing.
Now, here's a second question.

71
00:04:55,326 --> 00:05:00,829
If you created a crane or a frog, you
might say to yourself, you know what?

72
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:04,877
I love this crane and frog, but other
people would not.

73
00:05:04,878 --> 00:05:08,834
So you might be able to intuit correctly
that they are valuable for you

74
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:13,226
specifically, but not to other people.
You might say, well, you know, I like the

75
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:17,566
particular version of this tail, or I like
the particular version of how this is done

76
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:20,515
and it could have some interesting critic
value for you.

77
00:05:20,515 --> 00:05:24,669
But you could recognize that other people
who did not build it would not love it as

78
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,109
much.
Or you might be wrong, you might think to

79
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:31,120
yourself I love this and everybody else
would love it as well in the same way.

80
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,824
Which one of those was the case?
They felt that everybody would love it.

81
00:05:35,825 --> 00:05:40,046
So the people who build the origamis
thought they were more lovely and

82
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:44,602
wonderful, but they thought that other
people would recognize how wonderful and

83
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:48,354
lovely they were.
But people who were not involved in the

84
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:52,107
building did not have this sense of
appreciation.

85
00:05:52,108 --> 00:05:55,369
In the next version of the experiment, we
contrasted two things.

86
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,740
Some people got the easy instructions.
The same as they got before.

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,420
And for some people we basically
eliminated the legends.

88
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,080
We made it hard for them to understand
what are all the little rules on the

89
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,330
Origami instruction sheet, look like.
What is the little arrow?

90
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,761
What is the dotted lines, and so on.
Now it was harder for them to understand

91
00:06:14,761 --> 00:06:18,649
how to build origami.
And because of that, the origami they

92
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,866
built was even uglier.
Right?

93
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:25,356
So what would happen?
Again, the builder, who build easy origami

94
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:29,877
loved it more than the people who are not
involved in the building.

95
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:32,890
And what about the people who build the
difficult origami?

96
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:37,596
They loved it even more.
Although objectively it was worse, and the

97
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:43,104
people who are evaluating it thought it
was worse, the people who built it thought

98
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:48,050
it was much better.
So it means that not only does effort

99
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,663
increase love, more effort creates more
love.

100
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:56,886
Now there's one important issue, which is
you created an origami, but at the end of

101
00:06:56,886 --> 00:07:00,686
the day, it looked like nothing, right.
You basically made nothing, like, you

102
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,131
know, you work for a long time and at the
end of the day you couldn't really think

103
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,590
of it as an origami.
That did not create more love.

104
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:12,446
But to the extent that you build
something, more effort does create more,

105
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:17,280
more love.
I think the same thing happens with kids,

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,281
right?
Imagine the following.

107
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:24,396
Imagine that you go to a, a park.
And you come with your kids and I say, oh

108
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:28,200
you know, these are, these are great kids.
Would you sell them to me?

109
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,724
And don't worry.
They'll have a good life and I'll buy the

110
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:35,784
kids and I'll, let's say, erase all your
memories from your experience and thoughts

111
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:38,800
and wishes about these kids.
And you will be the same as you are now

112
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,760
just with no memory of the kids and more
money.

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,030
How much money would I need to pay you for
that?

114
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,490
And most people say, oh that would be a
lot of money.

115
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,054
I love my kids so much.
To compensate me for me, you would need to

116
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:53,927
pay me lots and lots and lots of money.
Now, think about the second case.

117
00:07:53,928 --> 00:07:58,117
Imagine you have no kids and you come to a
park and you meet two kids.

118
00:07:58,118 --> 00:08:02,914
These kids by the way are my particular
kids, the ones you see on the screen.

119
00:08:02,914 --> 00:08:06,702
And you come to play in the park with the
kids and you play with them for a few

120
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:11,703
hours and you learn everything about them.
And as you're ready to go the parent of

121
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:16,667
these kids say hey, by the way before you
say goodbye if you're interested they are

122
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:19,725
for sale.
Are you interested, and how much would you

123
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,560
pay?
And they're exactly like your kids.

124
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,689
Under those conditions, most people seem
not that interested.

125
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:30,790
Not that interested because we recognize
actually that our love to our kids is

126
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,538
partly due to them but it's partly due to
us.

127
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,907
It's partly due to the effort we invest in
them.

128
00:08:37,908 --> 00:08:42,720
And if you think about kids this way, kids
are actually the ultimate IKEA effect.

129
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,840
They don't come with instructions.
The instructions are actually very hard.

130
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,742
The amount of effort we invest in them is
dramatic.

131
00:08:49,742 --> 00:08:53,750
It's tremendous, more than, probably,
anything else that we do in our lives.

132
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,077
And as a consequence, our evaluation of
them changes very, very dramatically.

133
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:01,690
And not only that.
But we can't see that other people don't

134
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:05,120
see our kids in the same way that we do.
When I go to the park and my kids are

135
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,410
playing, I can't imagine that everybody
else is not interested in just sitting

136
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,236
there watching my kids.
I mean, I can't imagine that they'd watch

137
00:09:12,236 --> 00:09:14,836
their own kids.
I mean, why would they, when my kids are

138
00:09:14,836 --> 00:09:19,902
so wonderful and exciting and so on.
So basically we have both of these, love

139
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:24,247
is increased with effort.
But it also blinds us to the perspective

140
00:09:24,247 --> 00:09:27,725
of other people.
And we don't see it as well.

141
00:09:27,726 --> 00:09:32,317
By the way, you can think about lots of
implications for that.

142
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:36,487
Think about lots of places that allow you
to have tailor-made shoes.

143
00:09:36,487 --> 00:09:39,737
And allow people to design their T-shirts
and so on.

144
00:09:39,738 --> 00:09:44,060
Usually when we think about people
designing their own stuff.

145
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:47,880
We think about it as being something that
is good for individual fit.

146
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,292
I like red, somebody likes blue.
I like red, and you know whatever yellow,

147
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,910
somebody else likes red and something
else.

148
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,602
And usually, the idea of allowing people
to tailor something is to say people have

149
00:09:59,602 --> 00:10:04,166
very different levels of preference.
Let's allow people to pick whatever they

150
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:08,440
want and this way their preferences will
be satisfied to a higher degree.

151
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,360
But these results about the IKEA effect
suggest that it's not just about

152
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,627
individual preferences, it's also about
investing effort.

153
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:21,928
And this is actually important because if
you are creating something that allow

154
00:10:21,928 --> 00:10:24,823
people to design it.
If you don't think that effort is

155
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:29,377
important, then you want to read people's
minds if you could and just offer them the

156
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:33,840
thing that would be their best fit.
Or maybe you want to make it as easy as

157
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,497
possible for them to get something that
fits their preferences.

158
00:10:37,498 --> 00:10:41,720
But if you believe in a, in labor leading
to love.

159
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,750
If you believe that people need to put
their own self into something and work on

160
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,389
it, you know to like something more, maybe
that product needs to play hard to get.

161
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:53,550
Maybe the product needs to require some
effort.

162
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,510
Maybe the more effort that would be
created is actually quite important

163
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,064
because all of a sudden, it would lead to
higher level of love and higher commitment

164
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:06,353
to the product.
Now, of course, when we create something

165
00:11:06,354 --> 00:11:11,826
we have to balance multiple things.
On one hand more effort could lead to more

166
00:11:11,826 --> 00:11:16,829
love, on the other hand more effort could
lead to people abandoning this choice.

167
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,890
And the real question is what is the sweet
spot?

168
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:23,180
What is the amount of effort that would
get people to love what they're doing to a

169
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,140
higher degree without turning them off?
And I'm not sure there is an ultimate

170
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,001
solution for that because it depends on
how much you love.

171
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:35,090
The particular domain.
How much part of your personality it is.

172
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,624
How important it is for you.
So there are probably all kinds of things

173
00:11:37,624 --> 00:11:39,732
in the mix.
But it's important to think about both of

174
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,190
those things.
How do we get people to invest.

175
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,044
To care about it.
But not to require them to invest too

176
00:11:46,044 --> 00:11:49,223
much, that they will decide to just give
up.
