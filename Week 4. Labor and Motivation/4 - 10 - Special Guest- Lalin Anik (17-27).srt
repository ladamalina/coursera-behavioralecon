00:00:00,12 --> 00:00:07,194
Hello, my name is Lalin Anik, and I'm a 
postdoctoral fellow at the Center for 

2
00:00:07,194 --> 00:00:15,30
Advanced Hindsight at Duke University. 
Prior to starting my postdoc here, I 

3
00:00:15,30 --> 00:00:19,409
received my PhD in marketing, from the 
Harvard Business School. 

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,720
My PhD came at the expense of a life long 
hobby. 

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,137
I was a swimmer for nearly two decades of 
my life, which is a majority, majority of 

6
00:00:27,137 --> 00:00:31,234
it. 
And, being a national swimmer meant that 

7
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:38,210
I swam 25 hours a day, 8 days a week. 
And for such a long time, it's very hard 

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,942
to be constantly motivated. 
At the beginning, when I start around age 

9
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:46,580
6, I was motivated by the physical 
activity. 

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,880
Later on, when I started competing, it 
was the adrenaline rush and winning that 

11
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,316
got me going. 
But much later in my career, it was the 

12
00:00:53,316 --> 00:00:58,770
mental and aspect of swimming. 
That I loved, but when I look back two 

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:05,620
decades of doing the same activity meant 
different types of motivation throughout. 

14
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,400
To be motivated means to be moved to do 
something, to be energized towards an 

15
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,535
action, and when you think about it. 
You if, when you think about an 8-year 

16
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:18,495
old doing one task, let's say swimming 
versus an 18-year old swimming, you need 

17
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:22,690
to provide them with two different 
motivators. 

18
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,720
And, an 18-year old kid will not really 
be motivated by money, which is the most 

19
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
common incentive we use. 
If they win, we can give them a medal, 

20
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,352
but if we give them a $100 bill, they, 
they will not be swimming 5 hours a day, 

21
00:01:34,352 --> 00:01:38,343
with that $100 bill. 
They might be happy, happy at the 

22
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:43,170
beginning, but they'll forget that. 
And, I see this very similar in life. 

23
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,379
We might not be using money, we might, we 
should not use money with adults for 

24
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:51,78
every type of task. 
Because, might not, it might not be the 

25
00:01:51,78 --> 00:01:54,40
best incentive. 
This becomes more obvious when we think, 

26
00:01:54,40 --> 00:01:58,860
when we start thinking about the past 5 
years and the global economic crisis. 

27
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,581
Money is scarce and we should start to 
think about money and incentives in 

28
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:06,381
different ways. 
I, I think of this as similar to a car 

29
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:10,568
metaphor. 
So historically, we use cars and we, we 

30
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:15,266
use gasoline to fuel cars. 
But, as as the population of the world 

31
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:19,600
increases, we're running out of our gas, 
gasoline reserves. 

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,223
And as a result, we need to find new, 
environmentally, healthy, and friendly 

33
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:28,510
sources, fuels. 
And same with our, with ourselves our 

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,64
bodies and our souls are vehicles to move 
towards aims in life and many might not 

35
00:02:33,64 --> 00:02:38,980
be money like gas might not be the most 
sustainable incentive. 

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,402
We need to find normal ways and 
psychologically health healthy and more 

37
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:47,980
happiness-friendly fuel for our for our 
vehicles. 

38
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,564
So today, I'm going to talk about 
incentives, other than money that we can 

39
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:56,138
use to motivate people and their labors. 
In the first part, I'm going to try to 

40
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:59,504
answer this question, what are some of 
the incentives, other than money, we can 

41
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:03,673
use to get people going? 
So, rather than fuel, let's think about 

42
00:03:03,673 --> 00:03:07,760
electricity, wind, and water energies. 
And in the second part, I'm going to ask 

43
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,225
this question, can we use these novel 
types of incentives with every type of 

44
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:15,60
task? 
Meaning rather than car, shall move 

45
00:03:15,60 --> 00:03:21,254
towards hybrids or shall we go back to 
bicycles, our old ways of moving around? 

46
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:24,926
So, let's start out with thinking about 
some of the ways some of the incentives 

47
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:31,766
we can use other than money. 
historically, we have used money to money 

48
00:03:31,766 --> 00:03:38,600
to reward individuals, their labors and 
performances. 

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,740
And we have actually used individual 
incentives. 

50
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,78
But as humans, we're social animals. 
We spend 80% of our waking hours in the 

51
00:03:46,78 --> 00:03:49,895
company of others. 
So, why not use this natural social 

52
00:03:49,895 --> 00:03:55,454
disposition we have to motivate people. 
And this way, we can move away from 

53
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:59,650
individual incentives, towards more 
social incentives. 

54
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,890
And what, what is called, in the 
literature, as social motivation. 

55
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,316
What do I mean by social motivation? 
It means this energy and fuel we get from 

56
00:04:07,316 --> 00:04:13,48
the social context of our lives. 
So with Dan Ariely and our collaborator, 

57
00:04:13,48 --> 00:04:17,16
Michael Norton, we partnered up with 
global giving to, to, to test this power 

58
00:04:17,16 --> 00:04:22,8
of social motivation. 
Global Giving is a non-profit that works 

59
00:04:22,8 --> 00:04:28,380
with grass roots projects around the 
world and that connects them to donors. 

60
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,916
And you can, you can go on this website 
and find a charity of your interest, that 

61
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:37,228
interests you, and donate to this cause. 
Whether there, these are hungry kids in 

62
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:42,961
Africa or earthquake victims anywhere. 
And what we did is that we ran a bunch of 

63
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:46,220
experiments online with them. 
So if you were a participants in these 

64
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:49,620
experiments, you would go online, pick a 
charity of your choice, and we would tell 

65
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,270
you about the behaviors of everyone else 
who sees this who sees this charity, and 

66
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,909
we would give you a percentage. 
For example, we would tell you, 10% of 

67
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:02,996
people who saw this charity donate to 
this cause or you would hear 100 percent 

68
00:05:02,996 --> 00:05:08,268
of people, everyone who saw this charity, 
this cause donated. 

69
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:12,111
And what we find is that providing people 
with this information about other 

70
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:16,15
people's behavior gives them motivation 
to donate this cause now, as well as 

71
00:05:16,15 --> 00:05:22,89
commit to donating in the future. 
And what we find is that 70% is this key 

72
00:05:22,89 --> 00:05:25,878
percentage. 
This point, where telling you that 70% of 

73
00:05:25,878 --> 00:05:29,970
people, not hundred, not everyone, or not 
50, but 70% of, if 70% of people donate 

74
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,752
to this cause, that you, you are also 
going to commit to donating today and 

75
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:39,657
also you will sign up to for recurring 
donations. 

76
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:45,478
Why, why could this be happening? 
because, it's knowing that, you know, 70% 

77
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:50,600
of people are joining a cause, possibly 
legitimizes the act. 

78
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,416
It tells you that this is a worthy cause 
and you should, you should also join in 

79
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,730
this movement. 
Let's take another example. 

80
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,420
There's this website called 
kickstarter.com. 

81
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,92
It's an American-based crowdfunding 
website where you can post up a project 

82
00:06:04,92 --> 00:06:08,60
that you need funding for and you ask 
everyone around the world that this is 

83
00:06:08,60 --> 00:06:14,280
American-based, so the Americans to 
donate to this cause. 

84
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,700
And, let me give you an example. 
Let's say that there are two projects. 

85
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:23,0
There are two painters and they both need 
funding to rent a space, a studio space. 

86
00:06:23,0 --> 00:06:26,726
And they need money for paint, for canvas 
so that they can, they can do their art, 

87
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:30,236
and then, they can have exhibits and 
possibly make money, let's say from their 

88
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:34,894
art. 
And when we're visiting these two mm, 

89
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:40,223
causes on Kickstarter website. 
on, on one project, you see that no, no 

90
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:43,990
one has donated, zero people, in over 2 
weeks. 

91
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,305
In the other project, you see that, let's 
say 50 people have supported this 

92
00:06:47,305 --> 00:06:51,220
painter. 
Which project would you donate to? 

93
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,440
If you're like most people, you would you 
would stay away from this cause that was 

94
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,410
supported by no one. 
Because you would think, is this a 

95
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,650
legitimate course? 
Is this worthy of my money? 

96
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:04,162
And why didn't, everybody else, donate? 
But it, when you see 50 people donating 

97
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:07,244
to this cause, you will want to donate, 
because there's this element of being a 

98
00:07:07,244 --> 00:07:11,228
part of a community. 
Let's think about another example. 

99
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:16,979
So, Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia. 
That has open-source open contribution 

100
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,350
model. 
So everyone around the world can sign 

101
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,610
come and sign up. 
And they will contribute information. 

102
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,680
with no monetary compensation in return. 
But why do these people do it? 

103
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,40
It's basically for this feeling of being 
a part of a, a community. 

104
00:07:33,40 --> 00:07:36,816
By giving information, sharing 
information, and contributing to 

105
00:07:36,816 --> 00:07:42,410
Wikipedia, we become a part of this group 
who shares interests and needs. 

106
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,348
So it, it drives their behavior. 
So far, we have talked about social 

107
00:07:47,348 --> 00:07:51,750
motivation, and being a part of community 
as potential incentives other than money, 

108
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,890
or besides money, to is to motivate 
people's labors and contributions. 

109
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,60
Let's switch gears quickly and talk about 
some other motivator. 

110
00:08:02,60 --> 00:08:05,950
In this case, money is one currency we 
can use to motivate people. 

111
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,244
Let's think about an alternative 
currency. 

112
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:12,692
An alternative currency would be time. 
Just like money, it is they say time is 

113
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,337
money. 
It's a very significant aspect of our 

114
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:18,340
lives, and when it's gone, it's lost 
forever. 

115
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,553
I can, if I lost $10 yesterday, I can 
probably get it back, but when yesterday 

116
00:08:21,553 --> 00:08:25,415
is gone, there's no turning back, I need 
to move forward. 

117
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:31,512
So rather than giving people money, why, 
why shouldn't we give them time? 

118
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:36,336
Google got this right they have the 20% 
time program where they, they tell their 

119
00:08:36,336 --> 00:08:40,892
employees that they can spend 20% of 
their time on projects that are unrelated 

120
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:45,774
to work. 
3M did something similar to have a 15% 

121
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:50,121
culture where their employees, employees 
can spend 15% of their time on 

122
00:08:50,121 --> 00:08:55,620
initiatives and projects that are of 
their own choosing. 

123
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,527
Why is this important? 
By by giving people time, their 

124
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,601
employee's time, Google and 3M 
acknowledge that their employees are 

125
00:09:01,601 --> 00:09:05,99
individuals who can, who can control 
their time and who can have freedom and 

126
00:09:05,99 --> 00:09:09,340
autonomy. 
Autonomy is very important as a 

127
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,444
motivator. 
Best Buy also understood this, because 

128
00:09:12,444 --> 00:09:16,104
they have this program where their 
employees can do whatever they want, 

129
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:20,8
whenever they want it, without any 
schedules and without any meetings as 

130
00:09:20,8 --> 00:09:26,42
long as they get the work done. 
And the idea here is, again giving their 

131
00:09:26,42 --> 00:09:30,620
employees autonomy over their time, and 
possibly over their happiness. 

132
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,174
And this way, people can concentrate 
during the time that they're actually 

133
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:39,530
working, and then, be more creative and 
flexible during those 20%, of 15% of our 

134
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:45,170
time, of their time. 
So these are three of many variables we 

135
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,590
can use or incentives we can use besides 
money to incentivise employees or 

136
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:54,154
incentivise as people and labor in 
general. 

137
00:09:54,154 --> 00:09:59,54
But can we use these incentives in every 
situation or in every task, every type of 

138
00:09:59,54 --> 00:10:03,324
labor, or is there something about 
certain types of labor that make these 

139
00:10:03,324 --> 00:10:11,320
different types of incentives possible so 
we have a social disposition to be. 

140
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,22
We talk about the social disposition as a 
social motivator. 

141
00:10:14,22 --> 00:10:16,913
let's take this to a different type of 
task and I'm going to give you the 

142
00:10:16,913 --> 00:10:20,539
example of Lionel Messi who is arguably 
the best soccer player in the world and 

143
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,256
he plays for Barcelona. 
If we take him, he's very good at, he's 

144
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:28,840
very good at soccer and if we take him to 
El Clasico, which is one of the biggest 

145
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,424
derbies in the world between Barcelona 
and Gran Madrid, and we put him in a 

146
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:39,152
stadium of 80 to 100,000 people, he's 
probably going to perform really well. 

147
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:42,428
And, so will a lot of professional soccer 
players. 

148
00:10:42,428 --> 00:10:46,430
But what if we take Messi and get him 
into the stadium or in front of 80 or 

149
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,590
100,000 people and get him to cook or 
knit, or play [UNKNOWN] . 

150
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,672
This is conditional on the fact that he's 
not really good at these or he doesn't do 

151
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:59,690
these much. 
what, how will he perform? 

152
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:04,620
Will he perform at his beyond his base 
line level? 

153
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,645
the poet Zion in 1960;s said that talked 
about this idea of social facilitation 

154
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:14,0
paradigm and what he said is that having 
people around, the social presence of 

155
00:11:14,0 --> 00:11:19,550
others will motivate us. 
But he, what he showed is that if the 

156
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:23,570
task is something we're familiar with, 
having other people around will get us to 

157
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,410
do really well on that task, but if the 
task is null and we're not familiar with 

158
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:31,790
it, getting other people around will will 
provide an incentive, incentive and that 

159
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,170
will rise our adrenaline, but that will 
also arouse us and that will actually 

160
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:43,952
disable our performance. 
What I mean by this is the following, if 

161
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:46,810
we take Messi, he's really good at 
soccer. 

162
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,202
So putting and, and he has auto, 
automatic reactions, he practiced it 

163
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:53,170
well. 
So putting him in front of 80 or 100,000 

164
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:57,370
people will get will get him to do this 
task, this task he's familiar with much 

165
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,226
better. 
But if we put it put him in front of that 

166
00:12:01,226 --> 00:12:04,490
many people for a task he's not familiar 
with, curling or knitting, he's probably 

167
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,260
not going to perform at the level that he 
would if he were doing it alone. 

168
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,493
So there's this aspect of social 
facilitation, having other people that 

169
00:12:12,493 --> 00:12:16,498
will, that will incentivise our labor, 
and our behavior. 

170
00:12:16,498 --> 00:12:21,322
Finally I would like to talk about a 
certain type of task that is quite hard 

171
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:25,930
to incentivise and money might not work 
well in this scenario, and that is 

172
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,600
creativity. 
Creative tasks are are very interesting 

173
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,80
very it, they're very hard to incentivise 
and motivate with in many different ways. 

174
00:12:38,80 --> 00:12:41,162
Let's think about this. 
Possibly, some of you are authors, 

175
00:12:41,162 --> 00:12:45,131
painters, sculptors, and writers 
yourselves, and please think back to the 

176
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:50,600
time where you started this this hobby. 
It's probably you had a talent you 

177
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,840
thought that it's it was enjoyable and it 
became your favorite pastime. 

178
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,890
But as you moved on it life, as years 
passed and you came to a point where you 

179
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,190
needed to make a decision between this 
task that was intrinsically motivating 

180
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,927
for you. 
And when you looked when you moved away 

181
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:08,227
from your family and you needed to pay 
for your bill, you probably had to, had 

182
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:11,627
to make a decision whether this task 
that's intrinsically motivate, motivating 

183
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:16,170
will also pay for your bills. 
So you came to a fall. 

184
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,164
Some of you have quit or put, put this 
hobby aside. 

185
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:23,511
And, and other people thought that their 
intrinsic motivation to do it just 

186
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:28,740
overrode the pay that that they were 
going to receive. 

187
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:33,420
And, this is not, so this, this quandary 
between money and intrinsic motivation is 

188
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,970
not only for, is not only experienced by 
individuals, but organizations also go 

189
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,0
through it and they try to solve it, 
because they have a lot of employees and 

190
00:13:42,0 --> 00:13:49,276
they, if some employees do creative work. 
So how should employee, how should 

191
00:13:49,276 --> 00:13:53,542
organizations motivate their employees to 
succeed at these creative job, jobs and 

192
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:58,260
be more just be more creative and 
innovative, innovative? 

193
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,885
So, Adam Grant and James Berry ran series 
of experiments, looking at creativity in 

194
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:08,610
organizations and what kind of motivators 
should be used to get people to be 

195
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:14,730
creative and they actually approached the 
US Army. 

196
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,314
And they ran, they ran surveys with 
Security Force officers, asking them 

197
00:14:18,314 --> 00:14:22,260
about their job, and asking them how 
prosocial they are. 

198
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,668
This idea of caring about other people, 
which we, which I talked about previously 

199
00:14:25,668 --> 00:14:28,980
about community, in the Wikipedia case, 
in the charitable donations case, caring 

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,44
about other people is a main drive. 
And they looked at that specific drive, 

201
00:14:34,44 --> 00:14:39,290
this, and they, they looked at its 
relation to creative to creativity. 

202
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,470
And what they found is that people or 
security officer, officers who are 

203
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,74
intrinsically motivate motivated were 
more creative, but this but being 

204
00:14:46,74 --> 00:14:51,190
intrinsically motivated about a task, a 
creative task was not enough. 

205
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:55,814
They also needed to be prosocial, they 
also needed to care about other people, 

206
00:14:55,814 --> 00:15:00,914
their supervisors, their subordinates, in 
order to take that perspective and see 

207
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:08,230
what they would care about in order to be 
productive and creative at the end. 

208
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,12
So, it again comes back to this idea of 
social motivation that's other than 

209
00:15:12,12 --> 00:15:16,160
money, caring about other people, being a 
part of town, being a part of community, 

210
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,430
or just if you are doing some creative 
job caring about what other people will 

211
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:27,666
think and what other people will need. 
And as a result, what they found is that 

212
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,900
the those security officers who are 
intrinsically motivated, and also more 

213
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,18
were more social and caring about others 
needs, and were more benevolent had more 

214
00:15:36,18 --> 00:15:41,505
access to new ideas. 
And not only that, that when they had a 

215
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:45,795
bunch of ideas, they were able to pick 
through them and work more slowly through 

216
00:15:45,795 --> 00:15:50,610
these ideas. 
So today, I talked about two things. 

217
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,233
One is I talked about these different 
incentives we can use other than money, 

218
00:15:55,233 --> 00:16:00,132
social motivation, time, and being a part 
of a community that's get people going, 

219
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:05,377
get people energized. 
And the second part talked about 

220
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:09,152
different types of tasks, simple versus 
complex tasks. 

221
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:12,330
tasks we're familiar with versus normal 
tasks. 

222
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:16,746
And, and that's specifically about 
creative tasks that that are very 

223
00:16:16,746 --> 00:16:22,890
specific to, to, to think about in terms 
of different kinds of incentives. 

224
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,428
So moving forward, well, how shall we, 
how shall we proceed with these 

225
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:29,310
incentives? 
And my question there, and this is 

226
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:32,610
something I wonder about is with, with 
every new generation it seems like we get 

227
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,435
everything we want. 
And, and these, these things that we get 

228
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:40,612
are not dependent even on our labor. 
they, they might be used as incentives by 

229
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:44,29
our bosses, by our parents, but when we 
have everything and when a generation has 

230
00:16:44,29 --> 00:16:48,927
everything, how can you incentivise them? 
How can you get them going, and how can 

231
00:16:48,927 --> 00:16:51,982
you keep them active for, for labors or 
for things that they need to do for basic 

232
00:16:51,982 --> 00:16:56,360
things? 
It can be athletic activity, it can be 

233
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:02,340
school homework or it can be just finding 
a career that they like. 

234
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,566
So finally, I would like to part with a 
quote from a French novelist and 

235
00:17:07,566 --> 00:17:12,900
memoirist, George Sand. 
And she said, work is not man's 

236
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,184
punishment. 
It is his reward, his strength, and his 

237
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:21,352
pleasure. 
I hope that all your endeavours and all 

238
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:27,953
your work is always pleasure, 
pleasurable.
