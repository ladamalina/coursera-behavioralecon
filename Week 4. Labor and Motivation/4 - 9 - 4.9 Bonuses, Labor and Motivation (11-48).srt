1
00:00:00,855 --> 00:00:08,541
Now, so what this tells us about
basketball, is that in basketball, there's

2
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:16,160
a belief of clutch players, but there's
not the reality of clutch players.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,416
Especially not in percentage improvement.
And you know what, if we compare

4
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:26,131
basketball to Wall Street, basketball is
actually much more selective.

5
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:29,758
Many more people want to play basketball,
and the basketball league is actually

6
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:32,538
quite small.
Compared to the size of investment banking

7
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:35,731
for example.
And to be one of those 17 people who are

8
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,642
the clutch players, it's a much more
self-selected club.

9
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:42,798
These are people who are much more in
detail than bankers.

10
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:46,726
And basketball is much more mechanical
compared to banking.

11
00:00:46,726 --> 00:00:49,631
Right?
If you think about it, what we saw was

12
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:54,887
that bonuses were effective for mechanical
tasks and not for mental tasks.

13
00:00:54,888 --> 00:01:00,959
Basketball is partially mental, partially,
partially mechanical but banking is just

14
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,612
mental.
So with all of these could it be that

15
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:08,168
bankers are only improving with the size
of bonuses that they never get stressed

16
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,157
that they never get those decrease in
performance.

17
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:14,740
I don't think so.
I'll tell you one last thing.

18
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,789
When I go to these bankers one by one and
I say.

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,007
Tell me, what do people do in the office
in October, November, and December?

20
00:01:23,008 --> 00:01:26,839
They tell me, privately, that they don't
do anything but think about their bonus

21
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:30,302
and talk about their bonus.
That, every day, they pop up a spreadsheet

22
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:34,202
on their computer and they look at their
performance and they calculate their

23
00:01:34,202 --> 00:01:37,494
bonus, and they talk to their friends
about what it is and then.

24
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:41,430
The next day they do it again and again in
trying to figure out what will be their

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,208
bonus.
So even if they don't admit that this is

26
00:01:44,208 --> 00:01:49,092
stressing them out, they certainly admit
that this is taking part of their mind

27
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:51,448
share.
They certainly admit it's part of their

28
00:01:51,448 --> 00:01:55,308
thought processes.
Time, energy, attention is directed to all

29
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:59,015
these bonuses and away from actually doing
their work.

30
00:01:59,016 --> 00:02:04,427
So, what do we come out to this thinking
about bonuses.

31
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:08,405
Of course we talked about the fact that
money is just one of many motivators for

32
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:11,663
human behavior.
But even when we talk about money, money

33
00:02:11,663 --> 00:02:15,239
doesn't always behave.
In the way we think it should.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,302
We talked, when we talked about the
psychology of money, about how giving

35
00:02:19,302 --> 00:02:23,852
people small amount of money can sometimes
backfire, because it could make, change

36
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:28,402
something from a social relationship to a
financial relationship, from something

37
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:31,420
people do for you as a favor to something
they do as a job.

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,636
This is the low end.
At the high end, we see that bonuses also

39
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:37,269
don't behave in the way that we think they
would.

40
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,988
Sometimes we can give very high bonuses
and people try hard, but this fails

41
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:46,798
because they over try and they over
strive, and this pressure and attention is

42
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:51,644
actually getting them to prefer worse.
So when we think about money and about

43
00:02:51,644 --> 00:02:54,879
bonuses, I think we need to think very
carefully.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:00,220
What is this amount of money doing?
How is it changing human psychology?

45
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,744
How is it changing the minds of, how it
change the motivation?

46
00:03:03,744 --> 00:03:08,422
If we keep on having the view of people as
rats in a cage, with very simple rules

47
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:13,386
between, between rewards and outcome,
bonuses and performance, we're actually

48
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:17,782
going to get things wrong.
And we need to truly understand the

49
00:03:17,782 --> 00:03:22,914
nuances of human motivation and thinking.
If we want to use money in the right way

50
00:03:22,914 --> 00:03:26,826
to incentivize good behavior and not to
get lots of[UNKNOWN].

51
00:03:26,827 --> 00:03:32,147
If you think about everything we've talked
today, it's really about what are all the

52
00:03:32,147 --> 00:03:35,432
things that create motivation at the end
of the day.

53
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:39,945
And when we think about motivation, the
simplest thing is to think about

54
00:03:39,945 --> 00:03:43,940
motivation is all about payment.
We pay people they'll be more motivated.

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,487
We don't pay enough they'll be not as
motivated.

56
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:51,658
But I hope that what you think about now
is that these equation of motivation

57
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:56,020
includes all kinds of other things.
It's about Meaning and creation and

58
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,650
challenge and ownership and identity and
pride and all of those things.

59
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:03,097
And you can ask yourself and how do we tap
all of them.

60
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:07,666
If we want to motivate people, sure we can
do it with payment to some degree, but why

61
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,820
not tap all of those other, all of those
other elements.

62
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:17,107
Why not think about them as well.
And I recently got a call from a big bank.

63
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:22,882
This was a big bank that eh, takes 50% of
early profit and distribute them between

64
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:27,414
people work at the bank as bonuses.
And we spent about 2 hours on the phone

65
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:30,319
and they described to me the 16 equations
they use.

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,272
To identify how much each person should
pay, and they create an equation for how

67
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:38,034
much money directly they bring and how
much they help other people, and there is

68
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:41,967
an equation for this and an equation for
that, and there was 16 different equations

69
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,558
that determine it, and at the end of the
day they distributed a heck of a lot of

70
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:49,206
money to all of these people based on
these equations, enough that we went all

71
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:53,324
over them and we talked about this.
I said, what about other things, right?

72
00:04:53,325 --> 00:04:59,386
Why need you ask somebody who, gives a
check to somebody for over $5,000,000, to

73
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:03,534
also give them a hug?
Or maybe, invite them for a glass of beer,

74
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:07,196
or have dinner together?
I said, how much would that motivate?

75
00:05:07,196 --> 00:05:11,402
I asked the person sitting in front of me,
the person who was in charge of,

76
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:16,022
compensation, to say, "If you invited
somebody for beer How much less you could

77
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:18,857
pay them and still get them to work just
as hard.

78
00:05:18,858 --> 00:05:23,030
And that person said we would never give
hugs, and never give beers and invite

79
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:26,247
people for dinner.
I said first of all why not.

80
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:28,897
Second I said I think this is really
immoral.

81
00:05:28,898 --> 00:05:33,866
You are a public company.
You have my money I'm sure I'm invested in

82
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:38,698
you in some, some way or another.
How dare you not try to learn how to

83
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:43,640
optimize the motivation of people?
You're taking 50% of your profit and

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,760
distributing to people as bonuses.
Run giving them back to shareholders for

85
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,857
example.
Investing in the business.

86
00:05:49,858 --> 00:05:52,437
Are you doing this in the most efficient
way?

87
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:54,185
And the answer of course is not.
Right?

88
00:05:54,186 --> 00:05:58,928
And, and I think this focusing on people
work just for money is really a shame,

89
00:05:58,928 --> 00:06:02,970
because I think people don't enjoy their
jobs to the same degree.

90
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:08,147
But I think it's also immoral from the
perspective of public companies.

91
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:13,401
There is no question that the largest line
item for any company are salaries.

92
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:16,940
Why don't we try to figure out what
actually motivates people?

93
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,612
Why don't we try to figure out how to get
people to be happier in the job and work

94
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:26,430
harder eh, instead of just paying the
money and thinking that would rule eh, the

95
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,150
day?
Now of course it's good to pay people.

96
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:31,300
You should pay people a decent salary and
so on.

97
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:34,450
But if you're a public company.
This money's coming from somewhere else.

98
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:38,827
And you can, should think about where is
this money coming from.

99
00:06:38,828 --> 00:06:44,626
I will tell you one more story on this.
I had a student, who told me that he was

100
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:48,493
eh, working in a big bank, in New York
City.

101
00:06:48,494 --> 00:06:54,366
And the year was coming to an end and he
was waiting for his Bonus, and his wife

102
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:58,275
was about to give birth.
And his boss did here decided not to give

103
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:01,020
him a bonus , or give him a very small
bonus actually.

104
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,110
But he gave him an apartment in New York
city.

105
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,640
He was living out of the city and he was
coming in everyday to the city.

106
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,279
And he gave him his own apartment.
His boss gave him his apartment if he was

107
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,710
not using.
To use for the, and this way his wife

108
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,990
could, give birth in the city, this way he
could get home quicker, he would spend

109
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,337
more time in home, all kinds of things
like that.

110
00:07:23,338 --> 00:07:27,886
And the guy said, and, and it's been,
quite a few years since, it's maybe been

111
00:07:27,886 --> 00:07:32,278
12 years and I just met him a few weeks,
and he said that it's really amazing

112
00:07:32,278 --> 00:07:37,204
because This bonus was really cheap.
If you think about the rent per month for

113
00:07:37,204 --> 00:07:42,007
the whole year, was much, much less than
what he would have made in a bonus.

114
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:46,700
But the gift was thoughtful, and it was
useful, and improved his life in a

115
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,172
different way.
And he couldn't think about his job from

116
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:55,110
that point on in simple monetary terms.
Now we have this bond with this boss.

117
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,746
He cared about it, he followed this
mutuality, and he was not able to think

118
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:03,433
about it just in terms of money.
So when we go back and we think about

119
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:07,480
labor, thinking about money is important,
but there's all these other things we need

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,258
to think about.
And I think that if we don't, we're

121
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:14,129
actually doing harm, both to the companies
and to the employees.

122
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,280
The final thought I want to have about
this is this question between Adam Smith

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,255
and Karl Marx.
Which is the question between efficiency

124
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:28,310
and meaning.
So, Adam Smith had this very interesting,

125
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:34,060
influential story about the pin factory.
And Adam Smith said imagine somebody who's

126
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,153
doing.
Pins, and there are 12 steps in a pin, and

127
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:42,013
if somebody has to do step 1, and then
step 2, and 3, and 4, and 5, and 6, 7, 8,

128
00:08:42,013 --> 00:08:46,787
9, 12, and then move to the next pin, this
is incredibly inefficient.

129
00:08:46,788 --> 00:08:51,220
And if you have 12 people, each of them
doing one step, this becomes incredibly

130
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,776
efficient, and all of a sudden, 12 people
can do hundred times more than what each

131
00:08:55,776 --> 00:08:59,230
individual could do.
And these are economies of scale.

132
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:02,506
These are efficiency.
When people specialize and they state

133
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:07,970
doing one specific thing they can become
incredible good, incredible fast in this.

134
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:13,169
And because of that Adam Smith said that
we should work like in production plants.

135
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,440
Karl Marx on the other hand had a very
different idea.

136
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,280
He said it's all about the meaning of
work.

137
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,803
That the laborer needs to feel connected.
To its output and its effort and so on,

138
00:09:22,803 --> 00:09:27,402
and I actually think that before the
Industrial Revolution, they were both

139
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:31,430
correct of course, but Adam Smith was more
correct than Karl Marx.

140
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,588
Before the Industrial Revolution, what
kind of jobs were there they could find

141
00:09:35,588 --> 00:09:37,935
meaning in?
If you make a pen, sure you could find a

142
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:41,730
little bit more meaning, a little bit less
meaning, but the gains of efficiency are

143
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,207
so large, and the gains for meaning, I
think relatively speaking...

144
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:50,542
Are rather small, in, in that world.
However, I think that post the Industrial

145
00:09:50,542 --> 00:09:55,662
Revolution, and particularly in the
knowledge economy, Karl Marx ideas are

146
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:59,680
more important than Adam Smith.
Think about the current world.

147
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,901
The current world is world in which the
potential for finding meaning in our work

148
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:05,829
is tremendous, right?
All of a sudden.

149
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,710
We're connecting people, we are changing
economies.

150
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:11,620
I mean, there's all kinds of things that
meaning could get much larger.

151
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,950
The meaning of a pin cannot go that much
larger.

152
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:17,390
On the other hand, it's much harder to
supervise people.

153
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,950
Much more difficult to find out exactly
what people are doing.

154
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,939
Right now in most knowledge work, we trust
employees to do the right thing.

155
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,000
We can't supervise them and know exactly
what their doing?

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,968
There's a tremendous agency for people to
decide how much to work and how much

157
00:10:31,968 --> 00:10:34,267
effort.
There's also tremendous value for

158
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:37,774
creativity and ingenuity.
And we want people to think about work

159
00:10:37,774 --> 00:10:42,062
when they are in the bathroom and on the
drive home, and whentalk to their friends

160
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:45,267
and so on.
So while we have this tension between

161
00:10:45,267 --> 00:10:49,756
efficiency and meaning, between Adam Smith
and Karl Marx, I think the tension is

162
00:10:49,756 --> 00:10:54,877
going more and more towards eh, Karl Marx.
And more and more towards this idea of

163
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:59,277
finding meaning as an incredibly important
part of any job.

164
00:10:59,277 --> 00:11:03,501
And we need to figure out how to find
meaning, and how to search for it, and how

165
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:06,604
to help people create meaning, even if it
takes time.

166
00:11:06,605 --> 00:11:12,956
And even if it takes some money, it's
going to be a useful thing to do.

167
00:11:12,956 --> 00:11:48,337
