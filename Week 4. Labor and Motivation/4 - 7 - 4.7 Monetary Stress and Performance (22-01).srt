1
00:00:00,956 --> 00:00:10,537
When we think about the motivation, in
terms of salary, the usual assumption, is

2
00:00:10,537 --> 00:00:16,220
that people just want to rest.
And if we leave people alone, nobody would

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,168
want to work.
And because of that, we need to pay

4
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,995
people.
Basically the idea is, that people want to

5
00:00:20,995 --> 00:00:25,136
sit on the beach drinking mojitos.
But we, as their employers, don't want

6
00:00:25,136 --> 00:00:28,680
people to sit on the beach drinking
mojitos, so we have to pay them.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,310
And the payment, it's what's causing the
motivation.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,175
The motivation is leading to labor.
And the reason people are doing this labor

9
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:40,140
to start with, so they have enough money
to rest on the beach drinking mojitos,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,809
plus to pay bills and so on.
But the basic notion is that work is

11
00:00:44,809 --> 00:00:48,058
adversive.
That people hate working and the only

12
00:00:48,058 --> 00:00:50,740
reason that people work is to get, to get
money.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,720
Now of course, this is not, the real
reason.

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,492
And as we've talked already, there's lots
of other things that are happening in

15
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:59,654
labor.
People find tremendous amount of

16
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:04,013
satisfaction in labor.
In fact, even if you look at rats.

17
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:08,808
If you look at rats, and you say would
rats just want to work if they get food or

18
00:01:08,808 --> 00:01:11,620
do they enjoy working just for its own
sake?

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,046
Even rats enjoy work for its own sake.
So for example in some, eh, all the

20
00:01:16,046 --> 00:01:21,116
experiments on what is called counter
freeloading, what is happening is that

21
00:01:21,116 --> 00:01:25,952
rats and mice are given the choice of
either getting free food that doesn't

22
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:30,125
require any labor.
Or they have food that requires some

23
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,814
labor.
And you know what?

24
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:36,110
Sure they take some of the free food, but
they don't feed on that exclusively.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,410
They also go to the food that requires
some effort, and try to get that as well.

26
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,828
So it turns out that even animals are not
just about, eh, how much they can get

27
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:50,670
without working; even animals enjoy work
in some important ways.

28
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,224
And you can think about squirrels, you can
think about dogs, you can think about all

29
00:01:55,224 --> 00:01:58,463
kind of animals that seem to enjoy working
to some degree.

30
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:02,030
By the way the one exception so far, is
the domestic cat.

31
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,763
The domestic cat doesn't seem to enjoy at
all, labor.

32
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:08,130
And if they could do anything with no
effort it seems to be, they seem to be

33
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,888
doing it.
Okay, so that's the idea that life is

34
00:02:11,888 --> 00:02:17,047
composed by many more motivation than just
money alone.

35
00:02:17,048 --> 00:02:21,269
And we talked about meaning and a sense of
purpose and a sense of accomplishment and

36
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,499
competition and so on and so forth.
But now let's turn our attention to money.

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,092
Money is good.
Money is also one of the motivators.

38
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:31,580
The fact that it's only one of the
motivators, doesn't mean it's not an

39
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,862
important one, of course, it's a crucial,
important motivator.

40
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:38,567
And, for now I want to talk about one
aspect of money.

41
00:02:38,568 --> 00:02:41,940
So one aspect of money, is that we pay
people, and they get a salary.

42
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,767
And if they behave well, they get to keep
their job, and so on.

43
00:02:45,768 --> 00:02:49,221
But recently, there's been more and more
jobs that have bonuses.

44
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:54,990
And a bonus is a particular form of
payment, it's a form of payment that is

45
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,858
contingent on performance.
And I want to talk a little bit about how

46
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:04,537
bonuses work, what is the theory of
bonuses and how do they really work.

47
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:08,970
The basic idea of a bonus is that it, if I
offer you a bonus for a particular level

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,830
of effort, you would try harder.
And because you would try harder you would

49
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,250
be more successful, and therefore I by
providing you a bonus can redirect your

50
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:21,740
effort to be more productive.
But is that always the case?

51
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,081
And is it always that case that more
bonuses would yield to higher effort?

52
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:31,929
So there's an old research in psychology
on what's called the Yerkes Dodson Effect.

53
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,970
And the notion of that is that if we took
incentives, and we took performance, and

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,147
we said what is the relationship between
incentives and performance?

55
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:45,857
The usual theory is that as you increase
the incentives, performance will go up.

56
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,550
I offer you higher and higher bonus,
performance should go up.

57
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,230
Or maybe you could argue, maybe it would
go up to a certain level and then it will

58
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,198
have diminishing returns, it look kind of
flattened out, because at some point you

59
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:02,684
can't work harder.
But what Yerkes and Dodson argued, and

60
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:05,978
showed, is that the task actually looked
the following.

61
00:04:05,978 --> 00:04:10,466
When you increase incentives people
perform better, but above certain level,

62
00:04:10,466 --> 00:04:14,954
performance actually goes down, it's not
that is flattens out it actually goes

63
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:19,050
down.
How did Yerkes and Dodson first show this

64
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,356
effect?
They took, they put mice in a maze.

65
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:27,415
And the maze was changing every day.
And every day the mice have to learn, had

66
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:31,800
to learn what are safe areas of the maze
and what are dangerous areas of the maze.

67
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,370
So one day maybe the white symbolize safe
and the black danger.

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:40,100
And one day stripes were safe and polka
dots were dangerous and so on.

69
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,477
And what is safe?
Safe is a part of the maze that has no

70
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:47,560
electrical shock and dangerous is the part
that does have electrical shock.

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,970
And everyday the mice had to learn what
are the safe zones, and which are the

72
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,502
dangerous zones.
And over trial, across days, what Yerkes

73
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:59,337
and Dodson did, was to increase the amount
of the shock.

74
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,777
So sometimes the shock was very, very
little.

75
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:04,561
And guess what?
How fast did the mice learn when the shock

76
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:06,704
was very small?
Very, very slowly.

77
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:10,142
What happened when the shock increase in
intensity?

78
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,770
As the shocks increase in intensity, the
motivation of the mice was higher, and

79
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,234
they learned faster.
Right?

80
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,657
All of a sudden it's more informative,
it's more useful, it's more beneficial to

81
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:21,830
learn faster, and the mice were learning
faster.

82
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:27,615
But guess what, at a certain level the
shocks became so strong that the results

83
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,562
started backfiring.
At a certain level performance did not go

84
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:36,272
up, and it did not flatten, it actually
started getting worse and worse and worse.

85
00:05:36,272 --> 00:05:39,387
And you could probably imagine how it
would look for you.

86
00:05:39,388 --> 00:05:44,157
Imagine I asked you to walk around this
campus, and I made some buildings safe and

87
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:47,312
some building dangerous.
If the shock was tiny it was

88
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:52,208
uninformative, it was like so light you
would hardly feel it, you wouldn't be that

89
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:56,804
motivated to learn quickly.
As the shock went up, you'd probably care

90
00:05:56,804 --> 00:06:00,708
more about it and try harder and figure
out which buildings are dangerous and

91
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:03,385
which are safe.
You would commit it to memory, you would

92
00:06:03,385 --> 00:06:05,772
try to rehearse it, you would do all kinds
of things.

93
00:06:05,772 --> 00:06:10,913
But as the shock would become so strong
that it will take your breath away, that

94
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:16,127
you could not do anything else, the fear
of the anticipated shock will probably

95
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,156
paralyze you.
And you'll probably not be able to think

96
00:06:19,156 --> 00:06:22,326
about anything else.
And under those conditions, as the shock

97
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:26,102
would get stronger and stronger and
stronger, your memory would actually go

98
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:29,172
down.
But the results from Yerkes and Dodson

99
00:06:29,172 --> 00:06:35,069
suggest that this idea of increased
stakes, increased incentives to learning.

100
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,163
Might have these non linear relationship,
this inverse-u relationship, where people

101
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:45,253
could want to perform better, but actually
perform worse.

102
00:06:45,253 --> 00:06:50,538
So, with this, would this work?
And the basic idea that we went after, is

103
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:55,250
that as you promise people more money for
higher performance.

104
00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:00,867
As the bonus, potential bonus increases,
people want to perform better.

105
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:04,125
It's not as if, if I offer you a bigger
bonus you don't want to perform to a

106
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,334
higher degree.
You want to do it more, but the question

107
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:11,079
is, is it some level of wanting to do
something higher?

108
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,559
Can you do it, or does it backfire?
If you want to do it with all your heart

109
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:20,615
and soul and it's the only thing you can
do about it, can you actually do the job

110
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:24,785
better or do the job worse?
So how do we test this idea that the level

111
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:30,047
of bonuses could either positively, or
flat, or negatively influence performance?

112
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:34,740
In the US, it would be very hard for us to
afford big bonuses, the kind of bonuses

113
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,550
that people give truly in the work place.
So we went to India, we went to some small

114
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,170
villages where people don't make much
money and we could give them lots of money

115
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,568
in their currency, that would not be too
expensive for us.

116
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:50,406
And we basically created the following
experiment.

117
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:54,676
We gave people a set of tasks and to some
people we said, look, if you, if you

118
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:59,016
perform these set of takes to these
standards, you would get the following

119
00:07:59,016 --> 00:08:01,828
bonus.
And if you get it to a higher performance,

120
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:05,579
you'll get a bigger bonus.
So people had two levels of bonuses and

121
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,271
the question is would they perform below
the level of the first bonus, between the

122
00:08:10,271 --> 00:08:14,713
level of the first and the second bonus or
above the level of the second bonus?

123
00:08:14,713 --> 00:08:17,536
And on top of that we had three bonus
conditions.

124
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:22,832
Some people we promise what we call the
small bonus, which was if you don't do all

125
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:28,032
of these task as well you, as well as
possible, the best possible level you will

126
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:33,312
get one day of your salary, an average day
of people's salary in that particular

127
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:37,299
village.
It wasn't a tiny bonus because for one

128
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,508
hour they could get a one day salary, but
it was small compared to the other

129
00:08:41,508 --> 00:08:44,605
bonuses.
In the second bonus condition, we said, if

130
00:08:44,605 --> 00:08:49,291
you do these tasks well at the highest
possible level, you would get two weeks of

131
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,150
salary.
Right?

132
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:53,260
Much, much more.
And the third group we said, if you do

133
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:58,259
these tasks as well as, as possible, you
would get five months of salary.

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,944
So now think about it.
The first group had the maximum bonus of 1

135
00:09:02,944 --> 00:09:06,870
day of salary, two weeks of salary, five
months of salary.

136
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,784
Now if they perform half as well, they
would get half, a third , a third, and so

137
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,830
on.
The question is, how well would they

138
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,278
perform?
And how would the relationship look

139
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,762
between these two levels of bonuses?
And just think to yourself, if you had to

140
00:09:20,762 --> 00:09:25,580
draw this relationship, imagine a graph
and you have to predict what will be the

141
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,157
level of performance.
Will performance go up linearly?

142
00:09:29,158 --> 00:09:33,785
Will it flatten out or will it look like
the Yerkes Dodson Effect, where mutual

143
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,252
actually go, go down?
What, what would you predict?

144
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:40,685
Well here are the results.
We had many different games, and I'll show

145
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,912
you one after the other.
The first game was, eh, called the

146
00:09:43,912 --> 00:09:46,880
quarters game.
And in the quarter game, people have

147
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,232
multiple pieces of metal that each was
like a quarter and you had to fit nine of

148
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:54,997
them in a particular shape.
Eight of them is very easy, nine is a

149
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:59,742
little tricky and we gave people a time
limit and the question was could they do

150
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:01,900
it in this time limit?
What happened?

151
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,697
At the low level of the bonus, about 30%,
almost 30% of the people managed.

152
00:10:08,698 --> 00:10:13,320
In the middle of the bonus, slightly more,
almost 40% of the people managed.

153
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,559
What happened at the very highest level of
bonuses, the five-month salary condition?

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,210
Performance went down dramatically.
Now, almost nobody was able to do that.

155
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:26,597
The same result basically appeared in
other areas as well.

156
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:30,434
We had a game called Simon.
Simon is a game with four lights, and each

157
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:35,215
of them is associated with a tone as well.
And the machine presses them one after the

158
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:38,665
other, so you can hear a sound and, and,
see a light.

159
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:42,887
And you have to press it.
And then you see two of them, oh.

160
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:47,312
And then you have to do oh and it goes on
like this and it increases by one number

161
00:10:47,312 --> 00:10:51,695
every time for a long, long time until you
fail in repeating the exact pattern.

162
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:55,922
What happened?
In the low level condition people were

163
00:10:55,922 --> 00:11:00,750
quite good, the middle level condition
they were basically, almost the same, and

164
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,726
then at the highest level of bonus,
performance actually went down

165
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:08,690
dramatically.
In this particular game, we didn't see the

166
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:14,082
increase, we only saw the decease.
We had another game we called recall last

167
00:11:14,082 --> 00:11:17,356
three digits.
What we did in this game is we read aloud

168
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:21,250
to people a sequence of numbers, 7, 18,
25, 87, 76, 13, 18, 5, 3, 2, 17.

169
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:27,265
And then when we stopped in a random
place, we said please remember, recall,

170
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:30,961
tell us the last three ones that we said
aloud.

171
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:38,080
Could you do it?
And we gave people many, many chances to

172
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,660
do it and saw how many of them they could
do.

173
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:44,675
What happened?
Again no difference between the low level

174
00:11:44,675 --> 00:11:48,742
of bonus an the middle level, decrease for
the high level.

175
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:54,454
Another game we played was Labyrinth, its
a game with the plane in front of people,

176
00:11:54,454 --> 00:11:59,158
with the little ball and you can
manipulate the plane and shift it in

177
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:04,233
different directions, And this we get the
ball to on a particular path.

178
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:08,400
And we define a particular version that
would get people to perform well, and

179
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,870
another level that would perform very
well.

180
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:17,089
What happened now?
As bonus increased, performance just went,

181
00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:19,729
went down.
The same thing happened with some dart.

182
00:12:20,862 --> 00:12:24,760
A game.
We actually had initially some darts, with

183
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:29,710
a, a metal point, but we figured out this
was too dangerous, so we did a darts game

184
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,430
with tennis ball covered with velcro.
Here there was a slight increase between

185
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,568
the low and the middle and a slight
decrease between the middle and the high.

186
00:12:38,568 --> 00:12:43,534
Eh, we had another game in which you have
to spread two levers and a particular ball

187
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:48,725
has to go up, and how far can you get it.
In this one too we saw no difference, and

188
00:12:48,725 --> 00:12:52,203
then a decrease.
And if you look at all the results, and

189
00:12:52,203 --> 00:12:55,034
our task really kind of had three
components.

190
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:59,456
There was a creativity test, there were
concentration tests, and there were model

191
00:12:59,456 --> 00:13:02,408
skill tests.
Across all of them we basically saw one

192
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:05,247
pattern.
And if you average across all of them, no

193
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:09,525
difference between the low and middle
level, and then decrease at the high

194
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:12,830
level.
It means that as we get to high bonuses

195
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:18,152
things are not flattening out, they're
actually going, going down.

196
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:23,402
Now, when we started this experiment, we
actually had a slightly different,

197
00:13:23,402 --> 00:13:27,115
approach.
What we were going to do is we're going to

198
00:13:27,115 --> 00:13:32,080
use a principle called loss aversion.
And the idea of loss aversion, is the idea

199
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,030
that people hate losing more than they
enjoy gaining.

200
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:40,230
So if losses are more important than gain,
we said maybe we can create even more

201
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,947
stress by prepaying people.
So the idea was the following.

202
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,300
People came to the experiment, we prepaid
them.

203
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,588
If somebody was in the five months bonus
condition, we would give them all the

204
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:54,860
money in cash to put in their wallet.
And then we would say, please perform

205
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,662
this.
And if you perform it to the highest

206
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,724
possible level you will give to, you will
get to keep all the money.

207
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:02,980
But if you don't you'll have to give us
the money back.

208
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,180
Now financially it's equivalent, but we
thought that maybe if people have the

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,497
money on them the level of stress would be
higher.

210
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:15,530
And actually the first participant in that
experiment, in the five months bonus

211
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,990
condition, completely choked, he was
terrible.

212
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,590
He couldn't perform anything.
He was trying.

213
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,794
He was trying to focus.
He was trying to breathe.

214
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:25,300
But he was just failing time after time
after time.

215
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,440
And when he finished, he had to give us
back all of the money.

216
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,630
The next participant was the same.
He was trying to you know, concentrate and

217
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,251
focus and do some yoga and meditation.
But again, he couldn't do anything

218
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:41,130
correctly.
I have to say that at that point in the

219
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,414
game, which was going so well, I was a
little happy because I had, the results

220
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:49,766
were looking In that direction, that the
stress will overwhelming people's

221
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:53,080
performance.
But the second participant did something

222
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,556
unexpected.
And at the end of the experiment, when we

223
00:14:55,556 --> 00:14:58,500
asked him to pay us back all the money, he
turned around and ran away.

224
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,648
And the research assistant did not have
the heart to chase him.

225
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:06,296
So what we did was, we had to move to a
different village, because after the rumor

226
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:09,090
about this, came out we couldn't stay in
the same village.

227
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:12,878
And, and we also move to the other
approach, the one I described to you in

228
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:17,410
which, instead of giving people the money
upfront, we, gave him money at the end.

229
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,899
Now, this idea of giving people the money
upfront versus the end is important,

230
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,767
because it's a question of loss aversion,
but it also has another important point.

231
00:15:26,768 --> 00:15:31,580
Think about real bonuses in life.
Are they in the gain condition or the loss

232
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,420
aversion condition?
If somebody has been getting bonuses for a

233
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,001
few years, in which condition they are?
Now they don't have the bonus, so of

234
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:44,693
course strictly speaking they haven't,
they don't have the bonus and have to give

235
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:49,109
it up, but could it be that they are
already buying homes and cars and vacation

236
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:53,663
and sending their kids to school, under
the assumption that they will make this

237
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:56,404
bonus.
And now they're stressed about it to an

238
00:15:56,404 --> 00:16:00,692
even higher degree, because right now,
what happen is that people are in this

239
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,340
condition.
They think about losing, they think about

240
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,260
not being able to do everything they have
committed to, in some sense, and therefore

241
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,923
they are even more stressed.
Now as you can imagine, I've talked to

242
00:16:11,923 --> 00:16:14,894
many bankers about this.
And most bankers don't like it so much.

243
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:20,073
Actually when you describe the results,
about, people in India, and, students and

244
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:24,220
so on, they have no problem.
But the moment you ask bankers whether if

245
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,473
this could apply to them, their usual
answer is, no.

246
00:16:27,474 --> 00:16:29,110
Me?
Heaven forbid.

247
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:33,217
How can it be?
Of course it would never affect me.

248
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:39,183
And, now this, of course is a, goes under
the rubric of self-justification.

249
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:43,542
And we'll come back to it, eh, in a few
minutes to talk about whether this would

250
00:16:43,542 --> 00:16:46,704
apply to executives in high positions and
so on.

251
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:51,552
But before we continue with this, one of
the things that troubled us, was the fact

252
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:56,906
that all tasks basically behave the same.
In all tasks, performance was going down

253
00:16:56,906 --> 00:17:01,677
for the highest level of pay, and this did
not fit our intuition.

254
00:17:01,678 --> 00:17:05,722
Our intuition was that there would be some
tasks, particularly the mechanical tasks,

255
00:17:05,722 --> 00:17:08,299
that higher pay would yield higher
performance.

256
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,936
For example, what if I paid you to jump?
If I paid you a small amount to jump, or a

257
00:17:13,936 --> 00:17:16,712
medium amount to jump, or a very high
amount to jump?

258
00:17:16,712 --> 00:17:20,746
Don't you think that you would jump more
as the amount of bonus for jumping would

259
00:17:20,746 --> 00:17:22,830
go up?
At least that's the intuition.

260
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:26,526
I mean, by the way, the intuioton is very
different for mechanical task than for

261
00:17:26,526 --> 00:17:29,840
mental tasks.
Because in mechanical task, you're under

262
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,542
control of your muscles.
You can decide how many time to jumps, how

263
00:17:34,542 --> 00:17:38,967
much to try, eh, not to sleep, to stay
awake a bit longer and so on.

264
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,770
With mental task it's a bit more
difficult.

265
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:44,614
With mental task it's not the case that
you can just close your eyes and say I

266
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:48,829
want to think more, I want to remember
more, I want to do it to a higher degree.

267
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,832
So we thought that there should be a
separation between the mechanical tasks

268
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:55,796
and the mental tasks.
But we didn't see it in the first

269
00:17:55,796 --> 00:18:00,766
experiment, but maybe, we thought, it was
because our mechanical task was not, were

270
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:04,064
not just mechanical.
Throwing a ball, for example, is not a

271
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:07,069
simple mechanical task, it involves other
things.

272
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,085
So could we make the mechanical task even
simpler?

273
00:18:10,085 --> 00:18:12,359
Could we make it less?
And we tried that.

274
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:16,779
We did the simplest mechanical test we
could we asked people to put two fingers

275
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:19,523
on the keyboard and alternating pressing
them.

276
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:24,003
And the faster they alternated the higher
the performance, and the slower the lower

277
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:27,059
the performance.
So this was the mechanical test, very,

278
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,145
very simple, no thinking required.
The mental task was a task we took from

279
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:36,875
our experiments on dishonesty.
And we gave people a set of 12 numbers,

280
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:40,570
and we asked them to find two numbers that
add to ten.

281
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:44,216
And we gave people either this one or this
one first, and then we flipped it, and

282
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:48,390
then we gave it to them again.
And we did it for different levels of

283
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,668
bonuses.
And what happened?

284
00:18:50,668 --> 00:18:56,868
When we talked about the mechanical task,
as we gave people a higher bonus,

285
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:01,182
performance went up.
When we did the same thing with the mental

286
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:05,110
task, as we gave people higher bonuses,
performance went down.

287
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,975
So we replicated our previous result for
the mental arithmetic task, and we got the

288
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,777
opposite prediction for something that had
very, very simple mechanical task.

289
00:19:16,778 --> 00:19:21,670
And this I think suggest, that our
intuition about how bonuses would, eh,

290
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,340
drive performance is relying on intuitions
about mechanical tasks.

291
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,224
We think about ourselves as engines and
muscles and if you just try harder, if we

292
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:35,295
just got paid more, you would lift more
weights or jump more times.

293
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:40,191
Whereas the mind, tasks that have to do
with concentration, thinking, memory and

294
00:19:40,191 --> 00:19:44,727
so on are actually much more complex and
you can't will yourself into higher

295
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:48,880
performance in the same ease.
And in fact as you try to will yourself,

296
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,330
into higher performance, things can
actually go backward.

297
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:57,676
And you can ask yourself this question,
imagine you go into surgery, it's a very

298
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:03,022
delicate brain surgery, and just before
you go to, eh, your falling asleep, you

299
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:07,079
meet the surgeon.
And you can say thank you very much,

300
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,527
please do your best, or you could give
them a bonus.

301
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:14,333
You could say you know what, if you do
well, I'll give you $100,000.

302
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:18,690
Or maybe you can make, give him a negative
bonus, a punish, potential punishment.

303
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,848
You could say you know what, if you don't
do well, I hire two hit men to wait for

304
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:27,534
you outside the back alley and they would,
you know, break your knees or something

305
00:20:27,534 --> 00:20:31,280
like that.
Is this something that you would want?

306
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,635
Would you want your brain surgeon, as they
are operating on you, to think about

307
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:40,191
either the yachts they could buy with all
this money or their knees getting broken

308
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:43,789
if you don't do a good job?
Probably not, in fact there's a lot of

309
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:46,639
research in what is called a state of
flow.

310
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,015
And the idea of a state of flow, is that
once you get immersed in a task, you think

311
00:20:52,015 --> 00:20:56,525
about nothing about the task.
You're completely absorbed and consumed

312
00:20:56,525 --> 00:20:59,507
and focused on that task, nothing else
matters.

313
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,996
And this state of flow is what's driving
the highest-quality performance.

314
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:07,491
Now, from this perspective, it's kind of
strange to think about bonuses.

315
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:10,801
What are bonuses?
Bonuses are basically saying, I don't

316
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:14,705
think you're going to work for me very
hard, so what I'm going to do, I don't

317
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:18,929
think you're motivated, I think you want
to do it hard enough, so I'm going to put

318
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:22,961
a big pile of money on the way and by you
thinking about the money all the time,

319
00:21:22,961 --> 00:21:25,859
you're going to work in the way that I
expect you to.

320
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,802
What kind of task this is going to be
relevant to?

321
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:33,823
Well if it's laying bricks, or something
very, very mechanical, maybe it works.

322
00:21:33,823 --> 00:21:38,107
Are people thinking about the money and
that would motivate me to work harder, but

323
00:21:38,107 --> 00:21:42,265
anything else, do you really want part of
peoples' minds to be occupied with how

324
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:46,295
much money they're making and is this the
right amount and how much effort?

325
00:21:46,295 --> 00:21:49,962
Or do you want it to be in a state of
flow, fully consumed by it?

326
00:21:49,962 --> 00:21:53,862
And if you want a state of flow, maybe
bonuses are actually distracting, maybe

327
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:56,460
take, taking away attention rather than
helping.

328
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,413
Maybe they are decreasing motivation,
rather than increase motivation.
