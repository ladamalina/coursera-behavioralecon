1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,881
There's interesting company called Zappos.
Zappos is a shoe company.

2
00:00:07,881 --> 00:00:14,050
They actually ship shoes.
Somebody else makes the shoes and they

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,360
ship them.
And they do a nice job.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,760
And they have a really wonderful website.
And they're owned by Amazon.

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,664
It's a really nice company.
And one of the interesting thing about

6
00:00:22,664 --> 00:00:26,694
Zappos, they have lots of interesting
things about them, but one of them Is the

7
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,436
hiring process.
And what they do is they bring people in

8
00:00:29,436 --> 00:00:32,401
for training.
And they train them for quite a few days,

9
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,533
more or less a week.
And at the end of this training, they say

10
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:38,764
to people, we would love for you to be
part of the Zappos family.

11
00:00:38,764 --> 00:00:41,687
We would love for you to start working for
here.

12
00:00:41,688 --> 00:00:43,530
But this is not the right place for
everybody.

13
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,024
And if this is not the right place for
you, we don't want, we don't think this is

14
00:00:49,024 --> 00:00:53,356
something good for you.
And therefore, we will pay you to not take

15
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:56,656
the job.
And they started by offering people $500

16
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:59,750
and now they've increased up to $2000.
Now think about it.

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,000
What a crazy idea.
You come, you do a week of training.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,614
At the end of week of training they say
we'll pay you $2000 not to take the job.

19
00:01:07,615 --> 00:01:13,090
Now these are not highly paid people,
these are people who are going to get paid

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,697
12, 14, $15 an hour to do customer service
on the phone.

21
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:19,518
Why would Zappos pay people not to take
the job?

22
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:23,414
And they're are basically two reasons.
The first reason, if you think about the

23
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:27,444
distribution of people, the people who
love the job and the people who okay and

24
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:31,358
people who don't like it so much.
You actually don't want the people who

25
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:34,976
don't like their jobs so much to be around
because not only are they not going to do

26
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,378
a good job, they're going to pollute other
people.

27
00:01:37,378 --> 00:01:42,294
And Zappos is a customer service company.
They have fantastic customer service.

28
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:46,368
It's delightful to call them every time.
But you can imagine if they had people at

29
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:51,054
the negative tail, those people would give
customers a bad experience and they might

30
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:54,574
pollute other people.
So, one thing is the moving up and up on

31
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:58,530
trying to eliminate the tail.
People who are not that happy or don't

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,477
think they'll be that happy, they don't
want them.

33
00:02:01,477 --> 00:02:04,527
The second thing, I think, has to do with
cognitive dissonance.

34
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:07,356
Cognitive dissonance is a really
interesting phenomena.

35
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:12,364
Cognitive dissonance is about the fact
that if we behave one way but don't

36
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:18,150
believe in the same way, this creates a
tension, what Festinger called dissonance.

37
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,465
Can we change what we've done?
No.

38
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:24,240
We've done it already.
Maybe we can change what we believe.

39
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,413
And that actually happen quite a lot.
You behave a certain way, and then you

40
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:33,408
shift your belief to, to fit with that.
In some of the earlier demonstrations,

41
00:02:33,408 --> 00:02:38,302
they would get people and they would get
them to screw screws on a big board.

42
00:02:38,303 --> 00:02:42,311
Really boring task.
And they would do it for a very, very long

43
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,198
time.
And some people, they paid very well and

44
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:48,360
some people they paid $1.00.
And then they basically looked whether

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,364
people would recommend this to other
people.

46
00:02:50,365 --> 00:02:54,982
People who got paid very well said, you
know, this was a boring task.

47
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:57,628
I got paid well and this was a boring
task.

48
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,890
If you're going to do it, I think the task
is boring.

49
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:03,921
The people who got paid a dollar, had a
dissonance.

50
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:07,250
They worked on it for a long time but was
really boring.

51
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,454
Can they say that?
No, because they only got paid $1.

52
00:03:10,454 --> 00:03:12,973
They can't justify.
They can't say to themselves, ooh I work

53
00:03:12,973 --> 00:03:15,004
for really long time on this boring task
for $1.

54
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,890
So what did they do?
They shift it.

55
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,892
How interesting they found the task.
And now all of a sudden the task was too,

56
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:25,754
was more interesting, for them.
They, and they reported it to other people

57
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:29,557
as being more interesting.
This is, by the way, one of the, the

58
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:33,346
theory of why playing hard to get is a
good idea, right?

59
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,185
Because if you think that if people work
harder for something, they shift your

60
00:03:37,185 --> 00:03:40,334
opinions for it.
So, if somebody is easy to get people can

61
00:03:40,334 --> 00:03:44,510
say, oh, you know, I don't chase them very
hard and I don't like them very much.

62
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,128
But if you chase somebody and your efforts
show that you've chased them for a long

63
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:51,638
time, you spent lots of effort to it, you
can't think to yourself you don't like

64
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,395
them that much because there's a
dissonance between them.

65
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:58,395
So you have to increase your opinion.
Oh, they must be really fantastic because

66
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:02,616
I wouldn't have worked so hard if that
person was not such a fantastic person

67
00:04:02,616 --> 00:04:05,460
that they want so much.
Now, let's go back to Zappos.

68
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,429
What happened to Zappos?
You have these $2,000.

69
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,930
Now, it's not as if Zappos is telling you,
you know what, for the rest of your life

70
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,428
every morning you could wake up and decide
if you want to take the money or stay on

71
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,612
the job.
No, no.

72
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:21,518
You have 48 hours.
And if the end of 48 hours you decide not

73
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:25,958
to take the money, you wake up every
morning for the rest of your career at

74
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:30,990
Zappos and you'll tell yourself, I could
have gotten $2000 but I decided to work at

75
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,989
Zappos.
That must mean that I really love Zappos,

76
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,252
right?
Otherwise, why would I do that?

77
00:04:36,252 --> 00:04:39,964
And because of that, you go to work much
more excited and so on.

78
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:43,731
And from what I hear, the atmosphere there
is really like kind of a wonderful cult.

79
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:47,341
People are really happy with each other.
They celebrate birthdays.

80
00:04:47,341 --> 00:04:50,445
People live together.
There's all kind of wonderful things

81
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,338
happening.
And I'm sure there's lots of reasons for

82
00:04:53,338 --> 00:04:57,622
it but one of them is that now people
convince themselves that they must love

83
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,448
the place because they gave up so much to
be there.
