1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,860
In this section, we're going to talk 
about labor and motivation. 

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:08,540
And there's a little story that two men 
are playing golf. 

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,252
And as one of them is about to swing his 
club and hit the ball, they see a funeral 

4
00:00:12,252 --> 00:00:16,611
procession passing by. 
The guy puts his club down, he turns 

5
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,453
around to look at the procession, he 
takes his hat off and puts it on his 

6
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,942
chest. 
Then he kind of watch as the funeral 

7
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:27,200
procession goes, until they disappear 
over the corner. 

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,270
The moment they disappear he picks his 
club back, hits the, the ball. 

9
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,715
His friend looks at him and says really 
I'm really impressed I'm so touched and 

10
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,260
moved. 
We're in the middle of a golf game and 

11
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,221
you all of a sudden saw this funeral, you 
stopped everything you showed your 

12
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:44,930
respect for the funeral and for the dead. 
This is incredibly moving and touching. 

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:50,155
And the guy looks at him and says, well 
after all we were married for 30 years. 

14
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:55,250
[NOISE] What is the issue with motivation 
and labor? 

15
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,660
The reality is that when we think about 
it in a naive way we have a very simple 

16
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:03,888
equation for what gets people to work. 
We think it's all about money and money 

17
00:01:03,888 --> 00:01:08,550
is the key to labor and motivation. 
More money leads higher to higher amount 

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,745
of work, less money leads to less. 
The wonderful thing about human nature is 

19
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:16,990
we have all kinds of drivers that 
actually can change our motivation. 

20
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,790
And that's what we're going to focus 
about. 

21
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,840
We're going to look at the role of things 
like feeling of completion. 

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,710
And feeling of connection. 
Eh, camaraderie, goals. 

23
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,360
All kinds of things that basically change 
human motivation. 

24
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,266
And the hope is that by the end of this 
eh, section, we will have a better grasp 

25
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:39,280
about the whole range of things that can 
motivate people. 

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,504
And perhaps even more important about the 
things that we need to do to get people 

27
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:48,186
not to be unmotivated and unhappy with 
their workplace. 

28
00:01:48,186 --> 00:01:55,494
[MUSIC][MUSIC][NOISE] 

29
00:01:55,494 --> 00:02:15,330
So I want us to think about the 
marketplace and I want us to think about 

30
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:26,218
labor. 
And ask yourself what are the things that 

31
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:30,655
motivate people to work. 
Now the standard thinking about 

32
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:35,230
motivation is that people are like mice 
in a, in a maze. 

33
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:38,357
That's all we care about is the 
particular reward, the cheese, the food 

34
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:42,80
that, that we're getting. 
And if you think about life from this 

35
00:02:42,80 --> 00:02:47,110
perspective that people only care about 
the tangible rewards that they could get. 

36
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,930
You would design a particular kind of a 
workplace. 

37
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,386
And by the way, I don't think that this 
is a, a bad description for all places of 

38
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:57,910
labor, I think there's some things people 
do just for the money. 

39
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,535
That there's no other motivation. 
But the reality is that if you think 

40
00:03:01,535 --> 00:03:05,190
about your job, and if you think about 
the jobs of people close to you. 

41
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,460
How much of the motivation do you think 
is really driven just by the pure reward. 

42
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,248
Just by the money that we're getting. 
And by nothing. 

43
00:03:13,248 --> 00:03:15,454
Else. 
And if you think about it, you'll 

44
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:19,18
probably come to the conclusion that not 
much of our motivation toward label is 

45
00:03:19,18 --> 00:03:22,784
described by that. 
For example, if I took my job as a 

46
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:26,88
university professor, and I tried to 
think about what is it about my 

47
00:03:26,88 --> 00:03:31,29
particular rewards that could be 
described in terms of money. 

48
00:03:32,90 --> 00:03:35,303
Imagine we wrote an equation and we wrote 
all the possible things that could 

49
00:03:35,303 --> 00:03:38,603
motivate people. 
We could include things like pride, and 

50
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:42,173
we could include things like reputation, 
a sense of purpose, meaning and comradery 

51
00:03:42,173 --> 00:03:45,335
and feeling that you're doing something 
for the world and so on and money as 

52
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:49,591
well. 
How much of the total description could 

53
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:53,670
be attributed to money? 
Is money, money just one element? 

54
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,80
You know, some people who think of it as 
the only element. 

55
00:03:56,80 --> 00:03:59,864
But I would like to talk about the fact 
that there are many other elements. 

56
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:03,14
And those other elements are often 
incredibly important to understanding 

57
00:04:03,14 --> 00:04:06,127
total motivation. 
So let's take a step back, and let's 

58
00:04:06,127 --> 00:04:10,600
think about something as simple as 
mountain climbing. 

59
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,490
George Loewenstein has a beautiful 
description of this. 

60
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,706
When you look at mountain climbing, you 
look at professional mountain climbers 

61
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:20,814
who climb all kinds of difficult peaks. 
And you read there books. 

62
00:04:20,814 --> 00:04:22,736
What do you think you get from those 
books? 

63
00:04:22,736 --> 00:04:26,130
Do you get moments of elation and 
happiness? 

64
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,100
Do they describe are they about to sing 
and dance and tell jokes? 

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,280
As they go up the mountains? 
No. 

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,140
It seems like it's pure misery every 
moment. 

67
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,650
There are frostbite. 
It's difficult to breathe. 

68
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,420
It's tough. 
It's painful. 

69
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:44,16
You don't read these books and get a 
sense that these are people who are 

70
00:04:44,16 --> 00:04:47,303
having fun. 
You get a sense that they would be better 

71
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:50,200
off sitting on a beach somewhere drinking 
mojitos. 

72
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,122
But nevertheless, they do it. 
And not only do they do it, but the 

73
00:04:53,122 --> 00:04:56,804
moment they get up, they go down again. 
And when they come back, it's not as if 

74
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:59,674
they said, this was the biggest mistake 
of my life. 

75
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:04,988
They say, No, I want to do this again. 
By the way, I climbed when I was young I 

76
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:09,840
climbed a mountain in the Himalayas 
called Annapurna. 

77
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,780
It was about a month of hiking and 
climbing. 

78
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:18,679
And this was not as, as really serious 
and difficult as people who climb things 

79
00:05:18,679 --> 00:05:23,495
like Everest and go out, all the way up 
to the tip. 

80
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,570
But it was incredibly painful and 
difficult. 

81
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,848
And when I got to the top, I thought I 
would just sit there for awhile and take 

82
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:36,900
in the scenery and enjoy it, but the 
reality was, it was so cold. 

83
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,850
That I just walked down as fast as I 
could out of there. 

84
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,870
And again I don't describe it as 
happiness. 

85
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:47,540
But now many years later I keep on 
thinking that. 

86
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,334
I think, keep on thinking back into this 
event and I would like to go back. 

87
00:05:52,334 --> 00:05:55,483
Now the description of mountain climbing, 
and the description of sitting on the 

88
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:59,90
beach drinking margaritas are incredibly 
different. 

89
00:05:59,90 --> 00:06:02,860
Nevertheless, people are getting some joy 
from mountain climbing. 

90
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,410
What are the possible joys these people 
could get out of this? 

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,826
And you can think about all kinds of ways 
in which people do get joy out of these 

92
00:06:12,826 --> 00:06:18,616
very difficult, complex activities. 
A sense of accomplishment, a sense of 

93
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:22,58
competition, achievement. 
Overcoming nature. 

94
00:06:22,58 --> 00:06:25,520
Proving something to yourself. 
Right? 

95
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,300
You could think to yourself what would 
happen if you knew in advance that you 

96
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,740
could never reach the top? 
You could reach 90% but never reach the 

97
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,400
top. 
Would it be the same? 

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,70
Would you be motivated? 
Probably not. 

99
00:06:38,70 --> 00:06:40,320
It's probably the sense of 
accomplishment. 

100
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,840
Getting to the top without it, it 
wouldn't be the same. 

101
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,272
What if you knew that the moment you got 
down, your memory would be erased and you 

102
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:49,820
could never remember all that? 
Would you do it? 

103
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,950
Probably not. 
Probably part of it has to do with the 

104
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,830
fact that it enriches our life, our 
understanding of what we can do and so 

105
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:57,792
on. 
So if you think about it, and 

106
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,190
mountaineering is obviously an extreme 
example. 

107
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,285
But I think it does bring into mind this 
idea that we do things for all kinds of 

108
00:07:04,285 --> 00:07:08,370
reasons. 
And sure, money is one reason. 

109
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:12,165
But it's not necessarily the richness of 
all reasons, and not necessarily the most 

110
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:16,994
important one. 
Now, I should point out that sometimes, 

111
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:20,416
what we do is we give people money as a 
way to get to the other objective as 

112
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,631
well. 
So we can give people the sense of 

113
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:27,182
achievement, or competition, or personal 
progress by giving them money, but it 

114
00:07:27,182 --> 00:07:31,190
doesn't mean that that's what they're 
really getting. 

115
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,878
They're getting a sense of achievement 
through money they might have gotten 

116
00:07:33,878 --> 00:07:36,774
through something else. 
They get a sense of competition, they get 

117
00:07:36,774 --> 00:07:40,160
it through money they might have gotten 
it through something else. 

118
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,978
But instead of just thinking about money 
I want us to think about the whole range 

119
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:50,830
of what, what people aim for, strive for, 
and get value out of. 

120
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,307
And for me this became the most salient 
when one of my past students came to 

121
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:58,122
visit me one day. 
He popped into my office, this was quite 

122
00:07:58,122 --> 00:08:02,420
a few years after he left school. 
he reminded me who he was. 

123
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,100
Because I have too many students. 
And sometimes, I forget, their names. 

124
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,452
And then he sat down, and he described to 
me the following case. 

125
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:13,190
he was on Wall Street. 
He seemed to be very happy. 

126
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,204
He seemed to have a very high paying job. 
He seems to be dating a wonderful woman. 

127
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:21,60
working long hours. 
But, nevertheless, being very happy. 

128
00:08:21,60 --> 00:08:23,110
But he described to me the following 
thing. 

129
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,822
He said that, for weeks. 
He's been working on this presentation 

130
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:30,727
for merger and acquisition. 
And he worked on the presentation 

131
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:35,943
creating graphs and data points and 
speaking points and benefits and so on. 

132
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:40,39
And the day before the merger was going 
to go through he sent his boss the final 

133
00:08:40,39 --> 00:08:43,980
deck, the final power points 
presentation... 

134
00:08:45,50 --> 00:08:48,40
And very quickly, he got the note back 
saying, thank you very much. 

135
00:08:48,40 --> 00:08:50,154
Good job. 
The merger is cancelled. 

136
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:56,194
[SOUND] And he felt immediately deflated. 
Now, he worked on that for weeks. 

137
00:08:56,194 --> 00:09:00,604
Overtime, late at night, on the weekends, 
trying to do everything beautiful and his 

138
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:05,330
boss appreciated it. 
And he said his boss would give him raise 

139
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:08,570
because he did such a good job but 
nevertheless he was incredibly 

140
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,950
demotivated. 
The fact that his creation was never 

141
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,942
going to have any use and nobody else is 
ever going to see it made him lose faith 

142
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:22,699
in his job. 
In fact he wasn't sure he wants to work 

143
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:28,100
now on other projects like that. 
Now from an objective perspective, 

144
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,493
everything was okay. 
He worked, he enjoyed things as he was 

145
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,763
working. 
It was only after he finished, that 

146
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:38,862
somebody was not going to use it. 
I had another friend who told me a 

147
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:42,380
similar story. 
Her name was Devra, still is Devra. 

148
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,690
And she worked as an editor in one of the 
university presses. 

149
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,588
And she got this book in history that she 
really loved and thought was a great 

150
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,940
book, and she actually worked very hard 
to improve it. 

151
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,210
She was a fantastic editor. 
She gave me some comments on one of my 

152
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,810
books, too. 
She worked really well on that book. 

153
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,320
She felt that the book started by being 
good and she made it even better. 

154
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,515
She was very proud of her job. 
And when they handed the final manuscript 

155
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:10,310
out, the publishing house, the university 
publishing house decide not to publish 

156
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:13,810
this manuscript. 
She got paid. 

157
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:18,226
Her boss appreciate her job, her work. 
As she enjoyed it what she was doing she 

158
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:21,648
felt she was contributing but 
nevertheless because this was not going 

159
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:26,923
to see the light of day all of a sudden 
it had no, it had no meaning. 

160
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,900
And I can think to myself, if it's a 
university professor, right? 

161
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,840
What happens when you write things that 
nobody reads. 

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,116
You can think to yourself, what would 
happen if you wrote a blog post that you 

163
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:41,760
knew eh, nobody would read, or you write 
a paper that nobody would read. 

164
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,600
What is it about the joy of work that 
depends on something else happening with 

165
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,120
this outcome of this work? 
And this of course is the issue of 

166
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,442
meaning. 
It's the issue that when we have 

167
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:56,147
something, it's not just the creation of 
the thing that is important, it's the 

168
00:10:56,147 --> 00:11:00,670
meaning that it stands for. 
And if it has a meaning, we can be much 

169
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,4
more motivated toward it, and if it 
doesn't, it kind of goes away. 

170
00:11:05,4 --> 00:11:10,190
So, the way we decide to starting looking 
at this is to get people to build legos. 

171
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:13,993
In our particular case, bionicles. 
Bionicles are little lego robots that you 

172
00:11:13,993 --> 00:11:16,631
can create. 
They're kind of cute, they're kind of 

173
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,140
interesting, don't take too long to 
build. 

174
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,520
And we ask people to come and build them 
for money. 

175
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,980
And the way we had it done is in a few 
different conditions. 

176
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,130
In one condition, we asked people to 
build one, and we said, if you build this 

177
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,170
one, we'll pay you $3. 
Would you like to do it? 

178
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:34,912
People said, yes. 
They built it up. 

179
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:38,470
They finished it. 
Then we said, would you like to build 

180
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,627
another one, for $2.70? 
And if they said yes we gave them another 

181
00:11:42,627 --> 00:11:45,567
one and we took the first one that they 
built and put it under the table in a 

182
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,632
box. 
And we told them that when the experiment 

183
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:51,255
is going to be over we're going to take 
all the ones that they're going to be 

184
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:54,504
building today. 
We're going to take them into pieces, put 

185
00:11:54,504 --> 00:11:57,840
them back into the boxes for the next 
participant. 

186
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,368
And if they build the one for 270 we said 
you want to build another one for 240, 

187
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:04,840
and another one for 210 and another one 
for 180 and so on until they decide to 

188
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,544
stop. 
And we call this the meaningful 

189
00:12:08,544 --> 00:12:11,230
condition. 
People created something. 

190
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,740
They created more until they decide to 
stop. 

191
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,600
And what we measured was at what point 
did they stop? 

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,848
At what point? 
The value of building it was not worth it 

193
00:12:19,848 --> 00:12:23,265
for them. 
How much money they were getting was not 

194
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:27,670
going to offset the unpleasantness of 
building these legos. 

195
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,570
The second condition we call the Sisyphus 
condition. 

196
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:33,520
Now if you remember the story of 
Sisyphus, Sisyphus was punished by the 

197
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,775
Gods. 
To push a big rock up the hill, and just 

198
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:42,666
before he got to the end, the rock would 
roll over all the way to the beginning. 

199
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,180
And Sisyphus had to push it again and 
again and again. 

200
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,474
And this is a particular version of 
torture, right, when you have to do the 

201
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:52,203
same thing again and again, with no sense 
of progress. 

202
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,890
You could imagine what would happen if 
you pushed a rock up the hill, and at the 

203
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,25
end it would come to the bottom of 
another hill, and another hill, and 

204
00:13:00,25 --> 00:13:04,840
another hill, and another hill. 
Then you would feel some progress. 

205
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:08,740
But the fact that it's the same hill 
over, and over, and over, it's kind of 

206
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:15,430
the, at least in the perception, it's the 
ultimate way of demotivating people. 

207
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,236
Actually, if you look at prison movies, 
often that's what the guards do to 

208
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:21,172
prisoners. 
They get them to dig a hole and then they 

209
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:24,812
get them to put the the soil back into 
the hole, and they get them to do, dig it 

210
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:28,396
again or they get them to move rocks from 
one side of the yard to another side of 

211
00:13:28,396 --> 00:13:34,775
the yard and back and so, so forth. 
There is something about the uselessness 

212
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:38,82
of work when you just repeat something 
and destroy it, it seems to be. 

213
00:13:38,82 --> 00:13:41,860
[COUGH] Crucial. 
So in this specific condition we're 

214
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,95
starting the same way. 
We gave people a Lego robot, and we said 

215
00:13:45,95 --> 00:13:48,290
would you like to build this for $3. 
They said yes. 

216
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,840
They built it. 
And when they finished, we asked would 

217
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,308
you like to build another one for $ 2.70. 
And if they said yes we gave them the 

218
00:13:54,308 --> 00:13:57,102
next one. 
But as they were building the next one, 

219
00:13:57,102 --> 00:14:02,150
we took the first one apart. 
Already, put it back in the pieces into 

220
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:05,704
the box. 
And if they wanted to build a third one, 

221
00:14:05,704 --> 00:14:11,750
for $2.40 this time, we basically gave 
them back the first one they built. 

222
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,210
So in reality they build the same two 
bionicles. 

223
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,345
They would build and they would break, 
and they would build and they would 

224
00:14:16,345 --> 00:14:18,861
break, and so on. 
And this is the Sisyphic condition 

225
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:22,910
because of this endless cycle of building 
and breaking. 

226
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,494
So the first thing we find out, is that 
people built many more Bionicles in the 

227
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:30,140
meaningful condition and the sisyphic 
condition. 

228
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,444
And this is something that people 
basically understand that these 

229
00:14:33,444 --> 00:14:37,102
meaningful condition is much more 
important than the sisyphus condition 

230
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:40,890
attribute more meaning, they enjoy it 
more. 

231
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,477
You need to pay people less money. 
If you think about it, people get paid 

232
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:47,643
less and less and less and less. 
And if they continue more in the 

233
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:51,600
meaningful condition, it means you need 
less money to offset these people. 

234
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,760
In the Sisyphus condition the task was 
not as fun, and so they only worked when 

235
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,450
they got paid more. 
We did another version of this experiment 

236
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:04,945
that we called the Consultant Experiment. 
And we described to people the 

237
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:09,570
experiment, basically as I'm doing now. 
And we asked them to predict. 

238
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,315
How much people would work in the 
meaningful condition, and how much they 

239
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:16,120
would work in the sisyphic condition. 
We said imagine two factories. 

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,81
In one of them, people work like the 
meaningful condition, another one they 

241
00:15:19,81 --> 00:15:22,998
work like a sisyphic condition. 
By the way, we never use these names, the 

242
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,520
sisyphic and meaningful, but we describe 
those two conditions. 

243
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,607
And we say how, how much effort, how much 
motivation, how much output do you think 

244
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:35,420
there will be in both factories? 
And these consultants predicted that the 

245
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:39,580
meaningful condition would have a better 
output then Sisyphic condition. 

246
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:43,171
But they thought the effect would 
basically by one bionicle when in reality 

247
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:48,380
the difference was about four Bionicles. 
So people understand the role of meaning. 

248
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,900
They just don't understand it enough. 
They don't understand the extent. 

249
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,614
To which it is important. 
And the final thing we found out is that 

250
00:15:56,614 --> 00:16:01,60
we created the correlation between how 
much people love Legos. 

251
00:16:01,60 --> 00:16:04,470
You know, some people love Legos, some 
people don't right. 

252
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,600
That's a natural variations it's 
connected to all kinds of other things. 

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,936
And we ask how is the love of Lego 
connected to amount of bionicles? 

254
00:16:12,936 --> 00:16:15,988
You would build. 
And you would expect that people who love 

255
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:19,693
Legos, who get more internal joy from 
Legos would build more Legos even if they 

256
00:16:19,693 --> 00:16:23,606
got paid less. 
And people who don't like Legos that much 

257
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,644
would only work when they get paid more 
money and when they get paid a little 

258
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:30,530
less, they would stop. 
So we expect a positive correlation 

259
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,620
between love of Lego. 
And the amount of bionicles. 

260
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,600
And that's basically what we found in a 
meaningful condition. 

261
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,210
But in the Sisyphus condition the 
correlation was zero. 

262
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,498
Which basically tells us, that once we 
got to the Sisyphus condition, we were 

263
00:16:44,498 --> 00:16:50,324
able to choke the joy of those people. 
We were able to make this an unpleasant 

264
00:16:50,324 --> 00:16:54,100
Task. 
We're able to eliminate every particular 

265
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,586
value that they got from enjoying 
building Legos.
