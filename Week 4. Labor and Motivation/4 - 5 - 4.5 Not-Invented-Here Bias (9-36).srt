1
00:00:01,331 --> 00:00:11,417
The IKEA effect is not just limited to
physical things and kids.

2
00:00:11,418 --> 00:00:18,045
It also, works for ideas.
So imagine what happens when you have your

3
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:21,120
own idea versus other people have their
own idea.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,859
Are you more committed to your idea just
because.

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,120
It's your own.
You've all probably been in committee

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,064
meetings or group meetings when somebody
comes up with some, what seems to be like

7
00:00:31,064 --> 00:00:34,718
a random, stupid idea but the moment
they've said it, all of a sudden they're

8
00:00:34,718 --> 00:00:38,430
committed to it and they insist that
everybody would spend time and energy on

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,299
that idea.
Nobody is able nobody else is able to see

10
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:45,193
the value but because they've created that
idea they came up with all of a sudden

11
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:49,775
they think it's fantastic.
Turns out it's not just those people, it's

12
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:54,586
all of us.
So imagine what would happen if you had

13
00:00:54,586 --> 00:00:59,453
write your own ideas versus look at my
ideas.

14
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:04,899
So together with some colleagues, we did
this experiment.

15
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:09,973
We gave people that read the New York
Times a few big world problems, how to

16
00:01:09,973 --> 00:01:14,077
deal with global warming and water and
pollution and so on.

17
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:18,355
And we asked them to do one of two things.
We asked them to write solutions for those

18
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:23,648
ideas, how would you solve those problems
in different ways, and then tell us how

19
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:28,517
much they like their solutions and also
how much they like our solutions.

20
00:01:28,518 --> 00:01:31,160
And what happened?
People loved their solution much, much

21
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,086
better than they loved our solution.
But there could be all kinds of reasons

22
00:01:35,086 --> 00:01:37,256
for that.
First of all, they might have been able to

23
00:01:37,256 --> 00:01:41,266
come up with better solution than ours.
Maybe they're smarter than us the second

24
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:45,960
thing could be idiosyncratic fit.
There could be some people that, for

25
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,705
example, think that the right solution to
deal with world hunger is for everybody to

26
00:01:50,705 --> 00:01:54,164
be vegetarian.
And some people think that the world, the

27
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:59,631
way to deal with world hunger is to change
the economic incentives in Africa.

28
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:04,778
Some people might think that the way to
increase happiness is to everybody become

29
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:09,884
religious and some people might think that
the way to get more happiness is for us to

30
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:13,680
eliminate all religions.
So, it could be that it's not that their

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,234
ideas are better but each person has their
own version of the idea that they believe

32
00:02:18,234 --> 00:02:22,524
to higher degree or it could be the third
thing which is the IKEA effect which is

33
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:26,874
the pride of creation, so to look at this
more carefully, we change the set-up.

34
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:31,930
Instead of just giving them problem and
allowing them to write whatever they

35
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,842
wanted, we give them a list of 50 words.
And we said here is the problem, but now

36
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:41,504
you have this list of 50 words and you
have to use those 50 words to come up with

37
00:02:41,504 --> 00:02:45,216
a solution.
Use any words you want, but your solution

38
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:49,563
can be one sentence and only come with
those 50 words, and we see that those 50

39
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:52,420
words were the words we thought are the
solution.

40
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,378
In fact our idea was just jumbled up in a
different order in the first line of those

41
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:02,188
50 words, and because of that most people
came up with our idea, they basically

42
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:05,874
looked at all the words, and basic, oh,
one more thing.

43
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:10,020
And the rest of the words were just, eh, a
synonym of those words.

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,860
So in fact, the 50 words were basically
all going, people were going to come up

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,700
with our ideas sometimes with a word
change here and there, but basically all

46
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,647
of them came with our ideas.
What happened?

47
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,250
Now there was our idea that we asked them
to evaluate.

48
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,870
And there was our idea that we asked them
to evaluate but they came up with it from

49
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,120
a list of 50 words.
What happened?

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,620
They still thought that their idea was
much, much better.

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,022
Suggesting that it's not that their ideas,
that in the original experiment that it's

52
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:40,727
not just that their ideas were objectively
better.

53
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,820
It's not just they were idiosyncratically
fit better than they thought that they

54
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,741
were better.
There is something about the pride of

55
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:51,270
creation.
We pushed that idea even further.

56
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:58,570
We compared our idea, and then for other
people we gave them this idea, 7 words

57
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,480
idea.
We gave it to them, but in a different

58
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,861
order.
And we asked them to reorder the words to

59
00:04:03,861 --> 00:04:07,566
make a sentence, and there was only 1
sentence they could make from it which was

60
00:04:07,566 --> 00:04:10,130
our idea and once they had these 7 ideas
prearranged.

61
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,319
And how much did they like their solution
now?

62
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,875
Even now they liked it more.
Which means that the moment you get people

63
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:22,519
to invest even a little bit of energy all
of a sudden they think that, that solution

64
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,916
is much, much better.
In the history of ideas there's lots of

65
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:31,388
very, very notable people.
One of them of course is Edison.

66
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,040
The amazing inventor who came up with lots
of things, and we owe him much of our

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,423
progress.
But there's an interesting story about

68
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:43,420
Edison and Tesla.
And as you remember Edison basically

69
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,180
invented the direct current, what we have
in batteries.

70
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,597
And he basically was trying to get direct
current to be the thing that would fuel

71
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:58,618
the world or electrify the world.
And one of the people who worked for

72
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:02,324
Edison was Tesla.
Tesla was a young engineer, and he argued

73
00:05:02,324 --> 00:05:07,010
that direct current is going to have
strong limitations, and instead wanted to

74
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,802
use alternating current.
And he actually invented alternating

75
00:05:10,802 --> 00:05:14,656
current in Edison's lab.
Now, Edison, officially it could have the

76
00:05:14,656 --> 00:05:18,660
rights for alternating current because it
was developed in his lab.

77
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,880
It was part of his team of inventors but
he hated alternating current.

78
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,983
In fact, he hated it so much that he
basically got a fight with Tesla and Tesla

79
00:05:28,983 --> 00:05:32,030
left and took alternating current with
him.

80
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:37,406
And not only that, Edison then went to
great lengths to try and defame and bash

81
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:41,380
alternating current.
And this was actually funded.

82
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:46,684
The development of the first electrical
chair using alternating current to show

83
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:51,091
how dangerous it is.
Every time somebody got electrified by

84
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:57,188
alternating current, Edison paid a PR
company to go and make a big story out of

85
00:05:57,188 --> 00:06:00,433
that.
Eh, they would electrify animals, cats and

86
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:05,048
dogs to show how dangerous it is and by
the way in some sense he was right because

87
00:06:05,048 --> 00:06:08,667
in the early days, alternating current was
very dangerous.

88
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:14,476
But the reality is that direct current is
incredibly limited and if we every wanted

89
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:20,356
to electrify the world current to go far
distances and so on alternating current

90
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:23,744
is, is the answer.
But the interesting thing is, here is

91
00:06:23,744 --> 00:06:27,712
Edison, one of the most brilliant people
to have ever lived, one of the most

92
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:31,206
important inventors.
Nevertheless, I think that his love for

93
00:06:31,206 --> 00:06:35,430
direct current was so strong that he
couldn't see the benefit of alternating

94
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,279
current, and not only couldn't see the
benefit.

95
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,850
He was fighting them in order to defame
them and try to win in this current war.

96
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:50,545
In academic life, by the way, we have
something similar we call the toothbrush

97
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:53,836
theory.
The toothbrush theory is the idea that we

98
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:58,448
all need a toothbrush.
We all want the toothbrush, but nobody

99
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:03,460
wanted to use anybody else's toothbrush.
And the same thing goes for academic

100
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,623
theory.
We all want theories, we all like

101
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:09,517
theories, we all think it's important, but
nobody wants to use somebody else's

102
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:12,104
theory.
We all just want our own.

103
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:16,014
And I think it's kind of a fair and
important aspect to think about how much

104
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:19,982
do we really fall in love In what we're
doing and how much time we're willing

105
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:24,189
spend and effort and so on.
Now in the academic setting I think it's

106
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:29,927
really easy to see while falling in love
with our own ideas has pluses and minuses.

107
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:33,966
After all if you don't fall in love with
your idea, why would you ever work hard on

108
00:07:33,966 --> 00:07:36,240
it whether you're a startup or an
academic.

109
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,696
And if you fall in love with your idea you
would work hours and days in trying to

110
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:43,054
promote it and spend more time on it and
think about it and figure it out.

111
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:47,277
And really, really, really work very, very
hard to figure it out.

112
00:07:47,278 --> 00:07:49,330
If you don't like it so much, you wouldn't
do it.

113
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,400
That's the plus side.
The plus side is we tend to fall in love

114
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,732
and therefore we're willing to spend more
time, energy, effort and so on.

115
00:07:56,732 --> 00:08:00,728
The down side is that sometimes, we don't
recognize when things are failing.

116
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:05,424
Sometimes, we're so much in love with our
ideas, like with Thomas Edison or you can

117
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:08,446
think about other theories and economics
and so on.

118
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,826
That people fall in love with their
theories that they're not willing to

119
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:17,692
accept other things that might be better.
This, of course, happens in business all

120
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:20,735
the time.
This idea of "not invented here" that we

121
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:25,760
over-value what we are created and not
value what other people are creating, are

122
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,860
causing many companies to just look inside
for ideas and spend way too much time on

123
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,227
ideas they created And not look externally
for that.

124
00:08:34,228 --> 00:08:38,350
One of the most sad and interesting and
famous cases of this, of course, is Sony.

125
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,810
Sony was an incredibly innovative company
but at some point they started sitting on

126
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,130
their laurels.
They thought that they were innovating.

127
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,859
They thought that everything they do is
fantastic and what other people are not.

128
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,700
And because of that, they missed quite a
few revolutions in technology.

129
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,787
They missed a revolution in digital
cameras for a whole; they missed a

130
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:02,343
revolution in memory technology; they
missed a revolution in TV technology, all

131
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:06,832
kinds of things, because they just looked
inside, and anything that did not come

132
00:09:06,832 --> 00:09:09,798
from Sony was not value for them to the
nth degree.

133
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:13,926
So It's a mix.
We should love what we do but not too

134
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:16,256
much.
Somebody told me that the secret to a

135
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,874
happy marriage is to have life insurance
but not too much of it.

136
00:09:18,874 --> 00:09:26,609
Maybe the same lesson is here as well: We
want to love what we're doing but maybe

137
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:28,443
just not too much.
