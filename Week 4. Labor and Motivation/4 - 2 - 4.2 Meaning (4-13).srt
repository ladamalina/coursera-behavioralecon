1
00:00:00,931 --> 00:00:10,871
Sometime after I finished this first set
of experiments on Legos and Bionicles, I

2
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:18,723
went to talk to a big software company in
the northwest of the US.

3
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:22,663
And there were about 200 engineers in this
room and we arranged it like six months in

4
00:00:22,663 --> 00:00:26,348
advance.
And what happened was that a week before I

5
00:00:26,348 --> 00:00:30,884
came to present to these guys, they met
with their CEO and this was not a happy

6
00:00:30,884 --> 00:00:34,030
meeting.
This group worked on what they thought was

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,460
the next visionary project for this big
software company.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,706
They worked on it for two years.
They had an office that was outside the

9
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:45,150
rest of the campus of this company.
They were in downtown.

10
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,900
They were working hard in creating the new
vision for that company.

11
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:54,127
And the week before I came, the CEO sat
with them and cancelled the project.

12
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:58,170
And this was the most demotivated group of
people I've ever seen.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,806
It was really amazing.
And they all said they felt like they were

14
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:05,429
in the Lego experiment.
They felt they were working for a long

15
00:01:05,429 --> 00:01:09,212
time on something for two years.
They thought it was incredibly meaningful,

16
00:01:09,212 --> 00:01:13,700
incredibly important for the company and
all of a sudden somebody just destroyed

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,124
that.
And I asked them, I said how many of you

18
00:01:16,124 --> 00:01:18,327
show up to work now later than you used
to?

19
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:22,050
And everybody raised their hand.
I said how many of you go home now earlier

20
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,989
than you used to?
And they all raised their hands.

21
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:28,479
I said how many of you play more at work
and work less seriously?

22
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,884
And they all raised their hands.
And I said how many of you now play with

23
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,947
your expense reports these days?
And no body raised their hand.

24
00:01:34,947 --> 00:01:39,771
They laughed a little but, but then they
took me for dinner and showed me what they

25
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:43,724
could do with expense reports.
But the reality was that their CEO, I

26
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:48,070
think much like the consultant experiment,
did not appreciate the meaning.

27
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,150
Imagine you are a CEO and imagine that you
think about your employees like rats in a

28
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,490
maze.
All you need to worry about is how you are

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,030
organizing the incentives because the rats
would just figure it out.

30
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,320
There's no meaning, there's no purpose.
Rats just work.

31
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,456
And from this CEO's perspective, I think
he did not think about the meaning of

32
00:02:05,456 --> 00:02:08,640
these people's labors.
He just said OK, I made them run in this

33
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,054
direction for two years.
I don't think it's a good direction

34
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:14,600
anymore.
Let me just get them to run in a different

35
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,690
direction but not appreciating the
importance of all those.

36
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,810
And by the way, these were some of the
most creative, valuable people for that

37
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,357
company and many of them left afterward.
Now, I did ask them another question.

38
00:02:28,358 --> 00:02:31,497
I said, imagine that your boss had to
cancel this project.

39
00:02:31,498 --> 00:02:34,230
Let's say, for whatever reason, that was
the right decision.

40
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,350
Could he have canceled it in a way that
wouldn't have demotivated you to such a

41
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,962
degree?
And they all came with interesting stories

42
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:46,860
or interesting ideas for that.
They said, what if he allowed them to

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,787
present their project in front of the
whole company?

44
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,677
What if he allowed them to create a few
prototypes?

45
00:02:53,678 --> 00:02:58,682
What if he allowed them to think about
what aspects from this technology that

46
00:02:58,682 --> 00:03:03,106
they were creating could be useful for
other parts of the business?

47
00:03:03,106 --> 00:03:08,162
Now if you think about all of those
suggestions, they would all take some time

48
00:03:08,162 --> 00:03:10,835
and money.
Doing a presentation in front of the whole

49
00:03:10,835 --> 00:03:12,946
company would take time from all the
company.

50
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:16,657
Building prototypes and getting them to
run around the company and seeing in a

51
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:19,540
year or so, how people use them, would
take even more money.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,680
Getting them to think about how parts of
this technology could fit in other aspects

53
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,480
of the business would, again, take time
and effort.

54
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,759
And if the CEO doesn't think that meaning
is important, then why waste this time and

55
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,641
effort.
But if you understand how important

56
00:03:35,641 --> 00:03:39,186
meaning, is then it must mean that you
should invest some in it.

57
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:42,310
Now how much?
It's hard to tell because it's important

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,510
to understand how big meaning is but I
think in general we haven't a way to

59
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:51,134
underestimate the importance of meaning.
And by the way, other companies are doing

60
00:03:51,134 --> 00:03:53,685
it as well.
Companies like Google, for example, take

61
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:57,613
their employees, and give them 20 percent
of their time to work on other projects.

62
00:03:57,613 --> 00:04:03,404
Now, one of those things is to get these
20% of this time to make useful project.

63
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:07,448
But another part of it is to make people
feel valuable and useful and make sure

64
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:10,458
that they have something meaningful that
they're pursuing.

65
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,593
So, that's incredibly important.
