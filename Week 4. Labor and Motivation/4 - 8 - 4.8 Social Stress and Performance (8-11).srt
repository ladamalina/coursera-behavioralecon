1
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:07,076
The first experiments we did were with
financial bonuses.

2
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:13,759
But what about other forces?
For example, social recognition.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:20,692
We did a task of anagrams.
We asked people to solve some anagrams and

4
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:25,630
we paid them by their success.
And people were scattered around the room

5
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:30,447
and every person had the little cubicle.
And they were solving anagrams for pay.

6
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,876
But from time to time, we asked somebody
to get up, come to the board in front of

7
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:38,364
everybody, and solve the anagram in front
of everybody.

8
00:00:38,365 --> 00:00:42,445
They still got paid in the same way.
But now they solved it in front of

9
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:44,925
everybody.
Now would this be more important to

10
00:00:44,925 --> 00:00:48,700
people, or less important to people?
It's more important because you take the

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:53,322
financial motivation to solve anagram.
Plus you add to it the social desire to

12
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:56,530
have your friends think you're a smart
person.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:01,139
And to avoid looking foolish.
But what actually happened to performance?

14
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:07,285
Performance was about half as high in the
public condition than in the private

15
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:10,660
condition.
When people wanted the most to perform

16
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:15,502
well, they actually worked the hardest.
And this is of course things like test

17
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:18,887
anxiety and so on.
When we want to perform to the best of our

18
00:01:18,887 --> 00:01:25,123
ability, it doesn't mean that we can.
It means we want to but this wanting to

19
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:29,532
can actually overwhelm our ability.
So, what do we have?

20
00:01:29,532 --> 00:01:33,820
When we think about the relationship
between incentive and performance, we

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,577
usually think about just an increasing
amount.

22
00:01:36,578 --> 00:01:39,970
Sometimes we think about diminishing
returns.

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,361
Very rarely do we think that performance
would go up and then reverse, and go down.

24
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,932
But so far when we've tried things, this
is what we see.

25
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:54,767
And I should point that somebody did an
analysis of how people play golf when they

26
00:01:54,767 --> 00:01:58,796
play next to Tiger Woods.
This was in the period before he had all

27
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:01,750
these affairs and he was the top player in
the world.

28
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,724
And what do you think would happen to
somebody who's playing next to him?

29
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:10,347
Would Tiger Woods push them to be better
or stress them to perform worse?

30
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:14,157
Well, the results show that he stresses
them to perform worse.

31
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:18,987
By the way, from this perspective, it is
also interesting to speculate about Tiger

32
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:22,451
Woods.
He was a guy who was the most important I

33
00:02:22,451 --> 00:02:28,070
guess, successful golf player ever.
And all, he was at the height of his

34
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:33,350
career, all of a sudden he found out that
he has some affairs and his performance

35
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,453
drops down.
How can it be?

36
00:02:35,454 --> 00:02:38,067
Right?
I mean, could it be that he couldn't

37
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:41,623
concentrate, that he couldn't think very
much, that his mind was preoccupied?

38
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:46,854
I mean, that's one interpretation, but it
tells you how easy it is to get people to

39
00:02:46,854 --> 00:02:51,924
being distracted and by thinking about
some other things not performing very

40
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:53,900
well.
One of my friends had a different theory.

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,728
He said that maybe what he was doing is he
basically had no release for his sexual

42
00:02:57,728 --> 00:03:00,790
energy so he was all pent up and he
couldn't perform very well.

43
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,757
And I don't know how to differentiate
between these two, these two theories.

44
00:03:05,758 --> 00:03:09,337
So now, let's go back to Wall Street
executives.

45
00:03:09,338 --> 00:03:12,954
I meet these Wall Street executives, and
they say, oh, your results are very, very

46
00:03:12,954 --> 00:03:15,824
nice, but they don't apply to us, to the
Wall Street executives.

47
00:03:15,824 --> 00:03:18,755
Why?
Because your experiment, dear Dan, are

48
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:23,250
carried on regular normal people,
students, people in India and so on.

49
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,865
We are super special people.
If you hide the distribution of people, we

50
00:03:27,865 --> 00:03:32,222
would be at the edge.
Regular people would stress, get stressed

51
00:03:32,222 --> 00:03:36,410
by a thousand, 2000, $50 million.
We don't worry about this.

52
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,502
In fact, there's not an amount of money in
the world that would get us to go off the

53
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:43,714
continuous improvement.
And you can pay us as much as you want and

54
00:03:43,714 --> 00:03:46,585
we would always improve in quality and
never deteriorate.

55
00:03:46,586 --> 00:03:50,560
Now, of course, what I do when they say
something like this is to invite them to

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,770
the lab.
And I say you know what, maybe you're

57
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:56,475
right, why don't you come to the lab and
let's test things out and if you'll give

58
00:03:56,475 --> 00:04:00,408
me a research budget, we could see whether
you indeed don't get stressed with these

59
00:04:00,408 --> 00:04:03,916
large amounts of money.
But none of them is truly that interested

60
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:06,739
in doing it and nobody has ever appeared
in the lab.

61
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,266
But nevertheless, it was an important
point.

62
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,416
I don't believe that.
I don't believe that all the stress free

63
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:17,322
people are going to Wall Street and these
are not normal people and so on, but

64
00:04:17,322 --> 00:04:20,146
maybe.
Now testing people in Wall Street is very

65
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:22,627
tough.
So, instead what we did was we went to

66
00:04:22,627 --> 00:04:28,416
look at professional basketball players.
And together with Coach Kane the head of

67
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:35,059
the university basketball team and we got
his help to contact professional coaches

68
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:39,761
of teams at the NBA, the, the national
league for basketball.

69
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,940
And we asked him to tell us, who are the
clutch players in the league?

70
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,768
Clutch players are the people who get the
ball in the last second, and then shoot

71
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:51,024
the ball.
And everybody thinks that they are doing

72
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:55,160
fantastic job under stress.
And what was interesting is that all these

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,000
coaches basically agreed very well about
who were the clutch players.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,312
They named 17 people, and the agreement
was virtually 100% about who those 17

75
00:05:04,312 --> 00:05:08,587
people are.
And then we went back and we looked at the

76
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:13,126
whole season of basketball games.
And we looked at what was the performance

77
00:05:13,126 --> 00:05:17,004
of these clutch players?
So, we looked at how many points these

78
00:05:17,004 --> 00:05:21,740
clutch players em, eh, got in the last
five minutes of the game versus the last

79
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,660
five minutes of the first half.
Two five-minute periods.

80
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,242
One is crucial, one less important.
And then we also looked at the regular

81
00:05:30,242 --> 00:05:32,967
team members.
So, what do you think happened?

82
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:37,040
Did the clutch players have more points in
the last five minutes of the game compared

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,117
to the last five minutes of the first
half?

84
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,742
The answer is yes.
And did the team members get more points

85
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,834
in the last five minutes compared to the
last five minutes of the first half?

86
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:50,275
No.
So the first look it seems like regular

87
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:55,945
people, nonclutch players have a flat
effect from the 5 minutes at the end of

88
00:05:55,945 --> 00:06:01,197
the first half to the last.
And clutch players have an improvement.

89
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:06,522
But there two ways you could get more
points, you can get the ball passed to you

90
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:09,937
more, you can try more often, but just do
the same.

91
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:13,387
Or you can actually improve your
percentage average.

92
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:17,489
Which one do you think they did?
Did they just try more frequently or did

93
00:06:17,489 --> 00:06:21,368
they just improve their point average, or
a little bit of both?

94
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:24,942
Well, it's just that they tried more
frequently.

95
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:28,262
There was no higher success in terms of
percentage.

96
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,967
Other people seem to think the will try to
play him.

97
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:33,860
They passed him the ball.
They think that they're a clutch player.

98
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,094
They try more frequently.
Success is just the same.

99
00:06:37,094 --> 00:06:41,504
Now, these are good players.
They're fantastic players, but they don't

100
00:06:41,504 --> 00:06:45,371
have this improvement when you look at
percentage score.

101
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:49,596
By the way, when we ask coaches, coaches
believe that they actually have an

102
00:06:49,596 --> 00:06:53,002
improvement in percentage, not just in
absolute numbers.

103
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:57,082
So, what happens is we have a team.
And we all think that I'm the clutch

104
00:06:57,082 --> 00:06:59,737
player.
So, therefore, you pass me the ball, I

105
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:04,702
take more shots, everybody's happy.
There's a self-fulfilling prophecy, in

106
00:07:04,702 --> 00:07:08,967
which I act on our belief, but I actually
don't get any better.

107
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:11,103
Now, you couldn't argue, you could argue
against it.

108
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:15,450
And you could say you know what?
These clutch players are really getting

109
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:19,020
better, but what happen is the defense
also knows about.

110
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,616
So, now if I'm the clutch player,
everybody passes to me, the defense knows

111
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:25,557
about it and they're going to protect me
to a higher degree.

112
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:30,260
So, the fact I don't succeed more is not
because I didn't get better, it's because

113
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,454
the defense was ready for it and they got
better.

114
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,857
So, we looked at that as well.
We looked at free throws.

115
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:41,209
And now there's no role for defense,
you're just standing there and would you

116
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:42,691
do more?
So what happened?

117
00:07:42,691 --> 00:07:46,129
In the last five minutes, the clutch
players get more points?

118
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,594
Absolutely.
Do they get better percentage?

119
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:53,990
Not at all.
They get the ball passed.

120
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,956
They try more frequently.
They get far more frequently, they go to

121
00:07:56,956 --> 00:08:00,218
the line more often.
They take more shots, but do they do any

122
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:03,522
better?
Only in an absolute way, not in the

123
00:08:03,522 --> 00:08:04,618
perceptive.
